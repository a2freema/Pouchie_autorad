abstract = {The aim of this review is to consider variation in mating preferences among females. We define mating preferences as the sensory and behavioural properties that influence the propensity of individuals to mate with certain phenotypes. Two properties of mating preferences can be distinguished: (1) "preference functions'-the order with which an individual ranks prospective mates and (2) "choosiness'-the effort an individual is prepared to invest in mate assessment. Patterns of mate choices can be altered by changing the costs of choosiness without altering the preference function. We discuss why it is important to study variation in female mating behaviour and identify five main areas of interest: Variation in mating preferences and costs of choosiness could (1) influence the rate and direction of evolution by sexual selection, (2) provide information about the evolutionary history of female preferences, (3) help explain inter-specific differences in the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics, (4) provide information about the level of benefits gained from mate choice, (5) provide information about the underlying mechanisms of mate choice. Variation in mate choice could be due to variability in preference functions, degree of choosiness, or both, and may arise due to genetic differences, developmental trajectories or proximate environmental factors. We review the evidence for genetic variation from genetic studies of heritability and also from data on the repeatability of mate-choice decisions (which can provide information about the upper limits to heritability). There can be problems in interpreting patterns of mate choice in terms of variation in mating preferences and we illustrate two main points. First, some factors can lead to mate choice patterns that mimic heritable variation in preferences and secondly other factors may obscure heritable preferences. These factors are divided into three overlapping classes, environmental, social and the effect of the female phenotype. The environmental factors discussed include predation risk and the costs of sampling; the social factors discussed include the effect of male-male interactions as well as female competition. We review the literature which presents data on how females sample males and discuss the number of cues females use. We conclude that sexual-selection studies have paid far less attention to variation among females than to variation among males, and that there is still much to learn about how females choose males and why different females make different choices. We suggest a number of possible lines for future research.},

abstract = {Some controversy still exists as to how binary odorant mixtures are behaviorally perceived, despite many studies aimed at understanding this phenomenon. Binary mixture perception by rodents is a first step in elucidating how more complex odor blends may be perceived. Research thus far has examined how the degree of component similarity, olfactory receptor overlap, relative concentration of components, and even olfactory enrichment affect the behavioral perception of binary mixtures. These studies have aimed to categorize binary mixtures into I of 3 rigid categories, but often the results conflict as to which category a particular mixture belongs. In the present article, the authors used a habituation/discrimination paradigm to determine whether rats' perception of one component of a binary mixture of either perceptually similar or dissimilar components changed when the concentration of both components was varied together. The authors found that perception of a binary mixture changed with changing component concentration, such that one binary mixture could be categorized differently depending on component intensity.},

abstract = {The nonapeptides, oxytocin and arginine vasopressin, play an important role in mammalian social and reproductive behavior. Using immunocytochemical procedures, we identified oxytocin-immunoreactive neurons in the frontal and auditory cortices, limbic areas such as the medial septal nucleus, horizontal limb of the diagonal band and the amygdala. Only arginine vasopressin neurons were present in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In limbic-related areas, the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei and the nucleus centralis contained both oxytocin and arginine vasopressin neurons. The medial preoptic area showed a positive reaction for several arginine vasopressin fibers, but not oxytocin fibers, except in one female bat sacrificed during the breeding season. Arginine vasopressin fibers were observed in another limbic-related area, the periaqueductal gray. Furthermore, oxytocin was predominantly localized within sensory (e.g., auditory) and frontal cortex and limbic areas, whereas arginine vasopressin was restricted largely to known audiovocal regions of the periaqueductal gray. Classical neurosecretory nuclei in the hypothalamus contain both peptides. Oxytocin-immunoreactive neurons were also found in other structures such as the olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, primary and secondary motor cortex, fronto-parietal cortex, piriform cortex and the nucleus of the internal capsule. Both oxytocin and arginine vasopressin immunoreactivity was present in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, median eminence, neural lobe of the hypophysis and the pineal gland. Together with previous studies, the presence of these peptides within auditory areas of the cortex (sensory and frontal), and limbic as well as limbic-related regions provides anatomical evidence supporting their proposed role in social vocal behaviors and probably in auditory processing.},

@article{Clutton-Brock2012,
abstract = {In most social mammals, some females disperse from their natal group while others remain and breed there throughout their lives but, in a few, females typically disperse after adolescence and few individuals remain and breed in their natal group. These contrasts in philopatry and dispersal have an important consequence on the kinship structure of groups which, in turn, affects forms of social relationships between females. As yet, there is still widespread disagreement over the reasons for the evolution of habitual female dispersal, partly as a result of contrasting definitions of dispersal. This paper reviews variation in the frequency with which females leave their natal group or range (social dispersal) and argues that both the avoidance of local competition for resources and breeding opportunities and the need to find unrelated partners play an important role in contrasts between and within species.},

abstract = {Jung-Sheng Wu, Po-Jen Chiang, and Liang-Kong Lin (2012) Monogamous system in the Taiwan vole Microtus kikuchii inferred from microsatellite DNA and home ranges. Zoological Studies 51(2): 204-212. The Taiwan vole Microtus kikuchii is considered socially monogamous based on indirect information of captive behaviors and home-range ecology. Genetic components of its mating system were not previously examined. We tested the hypotheses that M. kikuchii is both socially and genetically monogamous by combining field information of home ranges with genetic analysis of relationships among individuals. Trapping was conducted in the Hehuan Mt. area of Taroko National Park, central Taiwan, from June 2004 to Aug. 2005. We chose 16 microsatellite loci using primers designed for M. oeconomus and M. montebelli to amplify M. kikuchii DNA. Eleven loci produced clear, polymorphic banding patterns and were used for the genetic analysis. The home-range sizes of adults did not significantly differ between sexes or among seasons. For the 14 social units indicated by overlapping home ranges, 11(78.6{\%}) were male-female pairs. The other 3 social units involved more than 2 individuals. In two of these, ranges of a male-female pair overlapped ranges of their offspring and other individuals. The genetic analysis revealed that some of the male-female pairs identified by overlapping home ranges did not reproduce. Information based on the home-range data was not powerful enough to identify genetic components of M. kikuchii's mating system and may provide misleading results. A parentage analysis based on microsatellite genotyping revealed litters (with a total 31 of offspring) sired by 18 males and 20 females. The only 2 males that fathered more than 1 litter did so in different years when their 1st mate was no longer present. None of the 9 litters with multiple offspring had more than 1 father. Home-range overlap was mostly between a single male and a single female and with their offspring. All pairs producing offspring were genetically monogamous. Our results strongly support the hypotheses that M. kikuchii is socially and genetically monogamous. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/51.2/204.pdf},

abstract = {Exposure of rats to aversive stimuli produces specific defence behaviour including the emission of 20–27kHz ultrasonic calls. Recent studies in this laboratory have shown that rats exposed to a 20kHz ultrasound tone display flight behaviour similar to that seen naturally, or following stimulation of brain regions associated with anxiety and defence. The present study examines the effect of ultrasound exposure on the central expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in the rat, in order to examine the brain structures activated by such behaviour. Ultrasound presentation produced rapid locomotor activity characteristic of defence behaviour, including brisk running and jumping behaviour. Animals showed dense c-fos like immunoreactivity in the dorsal periaqueductal grey matter, basolateral, medial, central amygdala, paraventricular thalamic nuclei and the dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, which was significantly greater than in either home-cage or arena control rats. These results suggest that exposure to artificially generated ultrasound can induce defence behaviour which is associated with activity in brain regions important in mediating aversion. This technique offers the potential of generating unconditioned aversive behaviour in rats in a non invasive way.},

abstract = {The type of social behavior displayed by an individual is profoundly influenced by its immediate social environment or context and its prior social experience. Although oxytocin is important in the expression of social behavior in several species, it is not known if social factors alter the ability of oxytocin to influence behavior. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that social experience and social context alter the ability of oxytocin to regulate flank marking (a form of scent marking) in female Syrian hamsters. Oxytocin was microinjected into the medial preoptic anterior hypothalamic continuum (MPOA-AH) of socially experienced, dominant female hamsters which were then tested with either a subordinate partner, with a novel partner, or alone. Oxytocin induced flank marking in a dose-dependent manner but only when the experienced dominant hamsters were tested with their familiar, subordinate partners. Oxytocin did not induce flank marking when injected into socially naive female hamsters that were tested with an opponent or alone. In males, by contrast, oxytocin induced flank marking in dominant hamsters when they were tested with their subordinate partner or alone. These data support the hypothesis that social experience and social context interact to regulate the ability of oxytocin to stimulate flank marking by its actions in the MPOA-AH in female hamsters.},

OT given before, but not after, the initial encounter restores social recognition in OT knock-out mice. Using c-Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) as a marker of neuronal activation in this initial encounter, we found similar neuronal activation in the wild-type (WT) and OT knock-out mouse in olfactory bulbs, piriform cortex, cortical amygdala, and the lateral septum. Wild-type, but not OT knock-out mice exhibited an induction of Fos-IR in the medial amygdala. Projections sites of the medial amygdala also failed to show a Fos-IR induction in the OT knock-out mice. OT knock-out, but not WT, mice showed dramatic increases in Fos-IR in the somatosensory cortex and the hippocampus, suggesting alternative processing of social cues in these animals. With site-specific injections of OT and an OT antagonist, we demonstrate that OT receptor activation in the medial amygdala is both necessary and sufficient for social recognition in the mouse.},

abstract = {The ability to recognize individuals is essential to many aspects of social behaviour, such as the maintenance of stable social groups, parent-offspring or mate recognition, inbreeding avoidance and the modulation of competitive relationships. Odours are a primary mediator of individuality signals among many mammals. One source of odour complexity in rodents, and possibly in humans, resides in the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The olfactory acuity of mice and rats allows them to distinguish between the urinary odours of congenic strains differing only in single genes within the MHC, although the chemical mediators or odorants are unknown. However, rodent urine also contains a class of proteins, termed major urinary proteins (MUPs), that bind and release small volatile pheromones. We have shown that the combinatorial diversity of expression of MUPs among wild mice might be as great as for MHC, and at protein concentrations a million times higher. Here we show in wild house mice (Mus domesticus) that urinary MUPs play an important role in the individual recognition mechanism.},

abstract = {The two nonapeptides arginine vasopressin and oxytocin are not only secreted from the neurohypophysis into the general circulation but are also released intracerebrally. Our recent research has focused on the release patterns and effects of oxytocin and vasopressin in brain areas, such as the septum and hypothalamus, that are thought to be involved in the regulation of (1) behavioural responses and (2) responses of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system (HNS) to stressor exposure in rats. The results demonstrate that combined physical and emotional stress (induced by exposure to forced swimming) selectively triggers the release of vasopressin within all brain areas under study but not into the general circulation. Under emotional stress conditions (induced by exposure to the 'social defeat' procedure), however, oxytocin rather than vasopressin release increased within the hypothalamus and septum. Experiments aimed at revealing the neuroendocrine and behavioural relevance of the local nonapeptide release provided evidence for an involvement of vasopressin in the regulation of HNS activity (within the hypothalamus) and, moreover, in acute stress-coping strategies, anxiety-related behaviour and learning and memory processes (within the septum). The observed dissociation between central and peripheral nonapeptide release not only supports the hypothesis that plasma vasopressin and oxytocin concentrations do not necessarily reflect central release patterns but also suggests vasopressin and oxytocin neurones are able to independently release their nonapeptide from different parts of their neuronal surface (e.g. from somata/dendrites vs. axon terminals). This remarkable regulatory capacity provides the basis for an differential involvement of vasopressin, and probably also oxytocin, in the co-ordination of neuroendocrine activity, emotionality and cognition at different brain levels to ensure an appropriate behavioural response of the organism to stressful stimuli.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t High levels of paternal care are important for the development of social behavior in monogamous rodents. However, the effects of paternal care on the formation of pair bonding and underlying neuroendocrine mech-anisms, especially the involvements of dopamine system and corticosterone, are not well understood. We in-vestigated effects of paternal deprivation on pair bonding in mandarin voles (Microtus mandarinus), a socially monogamous rodent. Paternal deprivation was found to inhibit the formation of pair bonding in females according to partner preference tests (PPT). Paternal deprivation also reduced body contact behavior and in-creased aggression in males and females in PPT. During social interaction tests (SIT), paternal deprivation was found to reduce investigative and aggressive behaviors but increase body contact and self-grooming in fe-males, and reduce staring, aggression, body contact and self-grooming in males when interacting with the opposite sex. Paternal deprivation reduced the expression of dopamine 1-type receptor (D1R) mRNA and do-pamine 2-type receptor (D2R) mRNA in the nucleus accumbens of female offspring in later life, but enhanced mRNA expression of these two dopamine receptors in males. After three days of cohabitation the expression of D1R mRNA and D2R mRNA was negatively correlated for voles reared by two parents, but positively cor-related in paternally deprived animals. Paternal deprivation reduced serum corticosterone levels in females but had the opposite effect in males. Three days of cohabitation did not alter corticosterone levels of PD fe-males, but reduced it in PC females. Our results provide substantial evidence that paternal deprivation in-hibits the formation of pair bonding in female mandarin voles and alters social behavior later in life. These behavioral variations were possibly associated with sex-specific alterations in the expression of two types of dopamine receptors and serum corticosterone levels induced by paternal deprivation.},

abstract = {Much attention has focused on distinguishing between social and genetic monogamy in avian taxa. However, surprisingly few studies have directly investigated this distinction among mammals. We investigated the genetic mating system of the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster, a popular model for mammalian monogamy and human attachment. We used space use patterns to define paired and single animals and assessed paternity using microsatellite loci. Prairie voles in this study engaged in significantly more extrapair fertilizations than predicted under genetic monogamy but fewer than predicted under random mating, demonstrating social but not genetic monogamy. Furthermore, we found that paired individuals were more likely to produce offspring than were unpaired individuals of either sex. This finding was true for both sexes and was attributable to differences in fertilization rates rather than litter sizes. Among mated individuals, however, faithful animals were no more successful than those that mated outside a pair. Taken together, our data demonstrate that paired prairie voles have greater breeding success than single voles, but such success is not contingent on mating exclusively with a social partner. If this species is to serve as a model for human love, our findings emphasize the need to distinguish between mammalian social attachment and sexual fidelity.},

abstract = {Vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) transcripts were localized in brain, pineal, and superficial brain vascular tissues of adult male rats using hybridization histochemistry and an [35S]riboprobe complementary to the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding the fifth to the midseventh transmembrane regions of the receptor. V1aR mRNA was extensively distributed throughout brain and was expressed in 1) superficial cells of the granule cell layers of the main olfactory bulb, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and cerebellum; 2) numerous anatomically distinct brain nuclei; 3) isolated cells dispersed throughout the central nervous system; 4) cells of the choroid plexus, occasional blood vessels in the olfactory bulb and interpeduncular nucleus, and extraparenchymal intracranial vasculature; and 5) some white matter structures. Numerous cells expressing V1aR transcripts were found in forebrain structures, including primary olfactory (piriform) cortex, the anterior and posterior olfactory nuclei; dorsal, intermediate, and ventral lateral septal nuclei; the septo-fimbrial nucleus and accumbens nucleus; and numerous hypothalamic regions with the most intense hypothalamic labeling in the arcuate, stigmoid, suprachiasmatic, and periventricular nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area. Cells expressing V1aR transcripts were ubiquitous throughout the midbrain, pontine, and medullary regions. A lower intensity signal was found in cells of the parvocellular paraventricular and anteroventral nucleus of the thalamus, circumventricular organs including the pineal, and the subfornical organ. V1aR transcripts were not generally detected in parenchymal vasculature, but could be found over large blood vessels in the interpeduncular nucleus and medial olfactory bulb; transcripts were commonly detected in perivascular brain cells. V1aR mRNA was abundantly expressed by choroid plexus, endothelial cells of midline blood vessels between the main olfactory bulbs, and superficial vascular tissue on all brain surfaces. These data confirm the presence of the vascular/hepatic-type V1aR gene in brain tissue and document an extensive expression. The distribution of V1aR mRNA suggests that there are at least two types of vasopressin-responsive cells in brain: one type exemplified by lateral septal ara neurons innervated by classical axodendritic/somatic synaptic vasopressinergic terminals and a second, perivascular/vascular type that would facilitate humoral vasopressinergic signaling in the brain.},

abstract = {For rodents, olfaction is essential for locating food, recognizing mates and competitors, avoiding predators, and navigating their environment. It is thought that rodents may have expanded olfactory receptor repertoires in order to specialize in olfactory behavior. Despite being the largest clade of mammals and depending on olfaction relatively little work has documented olfactory repertoires outside of conventional laboratory species. Here we report the olfactory receptor repertoire of the African giant pouched rat (Cricetomys ansorgei), a Muroid rodent distantly related to mice and rats. The African giant pouched rat is notable for its large cortex and olfactory bulbs relative to its body size compared to other sympatric rodents, which suggests anatomical elaboration of olfactory capabilities. We hypothesized that in addition to anatomical elaboration for olfaction, these pouched rats might also have an expanded olfactory receptor repertoire to enable their olfactory behavior. We examined the composition of the olfactory receptor repertoire to better understand how their sensory capabilities have evolved. We identified 1145 intact olfactory genes, and 260 additional pseudogenes within 301 subfamilies from the African giant pouched rat genome. This repertoire is similar to mice and rats in terms of size, pseudogene percentage and number of subfamilies. Analyses of olfactory receptor gene trees revealed that the pouched rat has 6 expansions in different subfamilies compared to mice, rats and squirrels. We identified 81 orthologous genes conserved among 4 rodent species and an additional 147 conserved genes within the Muroid rodents. The orthologous genes shared within Muroidea suggests that there may be a conserved Muroid-specific olfactory receptor repertoire. We also note that the description of this repertoire can serve as a complement to other studies of rodent olfaction, as the pouched rat is an outgroup within Muroidea. Thus, our data suggest that African giant pouched rats are capable of both natural and trained olfactory behaviors with a typical Muriod olfactory receptor repertoire.},

abstract = {Naturally occurring variations in neuropeptide receptor distributions in the brain contribute to numerous mammalian social behaviors. In naked mole-rats, which live in large social groups and exhibit remarkable reproductive skew, colony-related social behaviors vary with reproductive status. Here we examined whether variation in social status is associated with variations in the location and/or density of oxytocin binding in this species. Autoradiography was performed to assess forebrain oxytocin receptor (OTR) densities in breeding and non-breeding naked mole-rats of both sexes. Overall, males exhibited higher OTR binding in the medial amygdala in comparison to females. While there were no main effects of reproductive status in any region, a sex difference in OTR binding in the nucleus accumbens was mediated by status. Specifically, breeding males tended to have more OTR binding than breeding females in the nucleus accumbens, while no sex difference was observed in subordinates. These effects suggest that oxytocin may act in a sex- and region-specific way that corresponds to reproductive status and associated social behaviors.},

The recent development of tools and techniques has opened the door to refine the answer to these same questions with a much higher degree of specificity and accuracy, both in biological and spatial-temporal terms [3,4]. A variety of systems designed to test operant behavior are now commercially available, but have prohibitive costs. Here, we provide a low-cost alternative to a nose poke system for mice. Adapting a freely available sketch for ARDUINO boards, in combination with an in-house built PVC box and inexpensive electronic material we constructed a four-port nose poke system that detects and counts port entries. To verify the applicability and validity of our system we tested the behavior of DAT-CRE transgenic mice injected with an adeno-associated virus to express ChannelRhodopsin 2 in the Ventral tegmental area (VTA) and used the BNC output to drive a blue laser coupled to a fiber implanted above the VTA. Over 6 days, mice perform as it has been reported previously [5] exhibiting a remarkable preference for the port that triggers optogenetic stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons. We provide a low cost alternative to commercially available nose poke system.Our custom made apparatus is open source and TTL compatible.We validate our system with optogenetic self-stimulation of dopamine neurons.},

I analyze and summarize the empirical evidence supporting alternative hypotheses posed to explain the evolution of rodent group-living. Eight hypotheses are considered: two rely on net fitness benefits to individuals, five rely on ecological and life-history constraints, and one uses elements of both. I expose the logic behind each hypothesis, identify its key predictions, examine how the available evidence on rodent socioecology supports or rejects its predictions, and identify some priorities for future research. I show that empirical support for most hypotheses is meager due to a lack of relevant studies. Also, empirical support for a particular hypothesis, when it exists, comes from studies of the same species used to formulate the original hypothesis. Two exceptions are the hypothesis that individual rodents live in groups to reduce their predation risk and the hypothesis that group-living was adopted by individuals to reduce their cost of thermoregulation. Finally, most hypotheses have been examined without regard to competing hypotheses and often in a restricted taxonomic context. This is clearly an unfortunate situation given that most competing hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. I suggest that in the future comparative approaches should be used. These studies should examine simultaneously the relevance of different benefits and constraints hypothesized to explain the evolution of rodent sociality.},

abstract = {Individual recognition is expected to enhance fitness by allowing animals to direct appropriate behaviours to specific individuals during interactions with conspecifics. Reduced aggression towards territorial neighbours ('dear enemy phenomenon') is based on the assumption that strangers lacking territories pose a greater threat than territory-holding neighbours. Based on the ability of the subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum (tuco-tuco) to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar conspecific odours, I assessed whether males, the more aggressive sex, show dear enemy relationships and whether social experience with odour donors affects the memory of conspecific odours. Maleemale contests in the laboratory were used to compare the aggressive behaviour of pairs of males. Familiar male tuco-tucos responded less aggressively during contests than unfamiliar males, providing evidence of the dear enemy relationship in C. talarum. Memory for familiar odours was affected by social experience since discrimination of known from novel odours lasted longer when males encountered each other in dyadic contests following familiarization with odours. Familiarity by odour cues would represent an important mechanism mediating neighbour recognition and territorial behaviour for tuco-tucos in the wild; intruders may represent a threat of great consequence for territory-holding individuals since they represent the potential loss of their burrow system and their priority of access to neighbouring females. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {This article is part of a Special Issue "Energy Balance".Seasonal modulation of glucocorticoids plays an important role in supporting critical life-history events, and probably facilitates transitions between different life-history stages. In a well-studied population of red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis), glucocorticoids are elevated during the mating season, but males dispersing to summer feeding grounds have significantly lower baseline glucocorticoids than courting males at the den. We tested the hypothesis that decreased plasma glucocorticoids mediate the behavioral switch between reproduction and foraging in this species. Using a two-choice Y-maze paradigm, we demonstrate that males treated with the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (1 and 3. mg implants) prefer feeding cues (worm trail) over reproductive cues (female pheromone trail) significantly earlier than control-treated snakes. The metyrapone-induced changes in appetitive feeding behavior were independent of changes in plasma androgens and body mass loss. Metyrapone-treated males continued to court females at levels similar to those of control-treated snakes, suggesting that appetitive reproductive and ingestive behaviors are not mutually exclusive during this life-history transition. Consistent with this hypothesis, metyrapone treatment did not alter the number of arginine vasotocin-immunoreactive cells in any brain region, while it significantly increased neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive cell number in both the cortex and nucleus sphericus (homologues of the mammalian hippocampus and amygdala, respectively). Our results suggest that male red-sided garter snakes have the potential to maximize reproductive opportunities by continuing to court females they encounter even as they disperse from the den in search of food. Taken together, these data have important implications for understanding the neuroecology of seasonal life-history transitions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Central oxytocin (OXT) has anxiolytic and pro-social properties both in humans and rodents, and has been proposed as a therapeutic option for anxiety and social dysfunctions. Here, we utilized a mouse model of social fear conditioning (SFC) to study the effects of OXT on social fear, and to determine whether SFC causes alterations in central OXT receptor (OXTR) binding and local OXT release. Central infusion of OXT, but not arginine vasopressin, prior to social fear extinction training completely abolished social fear expression in an OXTR-mediated fashion without affecting general anxiety or locomotion. SFC caused increased OXTR binding in the dorso-lateral septum (DLS), central amygdala, dentate gyrus, and cornu ammunis 1, which normalized after social fear extinction, suggesting that these areas form part of a brain network involved in the development and neural support of social fear. Microdialysis revealed that the increase in OXT release observed in unconditioned mice within the DLS during social fear extinction training was attenuated in conditioned mice. Consequently, increasing the availability of local OXT by infusion of OXT into the DLS reversed social fear. Thus, alterations in the brain OXT system, including altered OXTR binding and OXT release within the DLS, play an important role in SFC and social fear extinction. Thus, we suggest that the OXT system is adversely affected in disorders associated with social fear, such as social anxiety disorder and reinstalling an appropriate balance of the OXT system may alleviate some of the symptoms.},

Although AVT/AVP behavioral functions and related anatomical features are increasingly well-known for individual species, ubiquitous species-specificity presents ever increasing challenges for identifying consistent structure– function patterns that are broadly meaningful. Towards this end, we provide a comprehensive review of the available literature on social behavior functions of AVT/AVP and related anatomical characteristics, inclusive of seasonal plasticity, sexual dimorphism, and steroid sensitivity. Based on this foundation, we then advance three major questions which are fundamental to a broad conceptualization of AVT/AVP social behavior functions: (1) Are there sufficient data to suggest that certain peptide functions or anatomical characteristics (neuron, fiber, and receptor distributions) are conserved across the vertebrate classes? (2) Are independently-evolved but similar behavior patterns (e.g. similar social structures) supported by convergent modifications of neuropeptide mechanisms, and if so, what mechanisms? (3) How does AVT/AVP influence behavior — by modulation of sensorimotor processes, motivational processes, or both? Hypotheses based upon these questions, rather than those based on individual organisms, should generate comparative data that will foster cross-class comparisons which are at present underrepresented in the available literature.},

abstract = {The neural substrate subserving magnetoreception and magnetic orientation in mammals is largely unknown. Previous experiments have demonstrated that the processing of magnetic sensory information takes place in the superior colliculus. Here, the effects of magnetic field conditions on neuronal activity in the rodent navigation circuit were assessed by quantifying c-Fos expression. Ansell's mole-rats (Fukomys anselli), a mammalian model to study the mechanisms of magnetic compass orientation, were subjected to natural, periodically changing, and shielded magnetic fields while exploring an unfamiliar circular arena. In the undisturbed local geomagnetic field, the exploration of the novel environment and/or nesting behaviour induced c-Fos expression throughout the head direction system and the entorhinal-hippocampal spatial representation system. This induction was significantly suppressed by exposure to periodically changing and/or shielded magnetic fields; discrete decreases in c-Fos were seen in the dorsal tegmental nucleus, the anterodorsal and the laterodorsal thalamic nuclei, the postsubiculum, the retrosplenial and entorhinal cortices, and the hippocampus. Moreover, in inactive animals, magnetic field intensity manipulation suppressed c-Fos expression in the CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus and the dorsal subiculum, but induced expression in the polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus. These findings suggest that key constituents of the rodent navigation circuit contain populations of neurons responsive to magnetic stimuli. Thus, magnetic information may be integrated with multimodal sensory and motor information into a common spatial representation of allocentric space within this circuit. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

Association is a proximate mechanism that underlies kin recognition for vole species that have been examined. Yet association during preweaning may not be adequate for all species at certain times of year. Some vole species form communal groups during the breeding season, whereas other species nest communally during the nonbreeding season. Moreover, individuals of some species of voles nest together at high densities, whereas individuals of other species disperse at high densities. Familiarity based on association is the cue that voles use to discriminate between elose relatives and unrelated individuals. Voles do not recognize unfamiliar elose relatives. Conse- quently, the ability to recognize kin may be limited to individuals that are philopatric or have repeated contacts with elose relatives. Therefore, the ability to recognize kin may be dependent on the mating system, social organization, and habitat of a particular species.},

abstract = {In the olfactory system, cholinergic modulation has been associated with contrast modulation and changes in receptive fields in the olfactory bulb, as well the learning of odor associations in olfactory cortex. Computational modeling and behavioral studies suggest that cholinergic modulation could improve sensory processing and learning while preventing pro-active interference when task demands are high. However, how sensory inputs and/or learning regulate incoming modulation has not yet been elucidated. We here use a computational model of the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex (PC) and horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) to explore how olfactory learning could regulate cholinergic inputs to the system in a closed feedback loop. In our model, the novelty of an odor is reflected in firing rates and sparseness of cortical neurons in response to that odor and these firing rates can directly regulate learning in the system by modifying cholinergic inputs to the system. In the model, cholinergic neurons reduce their firing in response to familiar odors—reducing plasticity in the PC, but increase their firing in response to novel odor—increasing PC plasticity. Recordings from HDB neurons in awake behaving rats reflect predictions from the model by showing that a subset of neurons decrease their firing as an odor becomes familiar.},

abstract = {Oxytocin, when administered centrally, has been associated with the modulation of various social initiatives including maternal and sexual behaviors. The nature of these effects depends on gonadal hormone status. In the present experiments, we investigated the effects of centrally administered oxytocin on the behavior of pair-housed male squirrel monkeys during interactions with a familiar female monkey. Pairs of male squirrel monkeys established reliable and persistent dominance relationships with dominant males showing increased sexual and aggressive behavior as well as higher plasma concentrations of testosterone. Oxytocin (0.1, 1.0 micrograms) increased the sexual and aggressive behavior of dominant monkeys without affecting these measures in the subordinate monkeys. In contrast to these effects in the dominant monkeys, oxytocin increased associative and marking behaviors only in subordinate monkeys. Central administration of the oxytocin receptor antagonis d(CH2)5 [Tyr(Me)2, Thr4,Tyr-NH2(9)] OVT (OTA; 0.05 microgram) had no intrinsic effect on behavior but blocked the effects of exogenous oxytocin. To investigate further the specificity of oxytocin's effects on social behavior, we administered the structurally related peptide arginine vasopressin under identical conditions. Vasopressin (0.5, 5.0 micrograms) decreased social behaviors and increased motor activity in both dominant and subordinate monkeys. Previous studies in rodents have demonstrated that oxytocin receptors are induced by gonadal steroids in a regionally specific fashion. The status-related behavioral effects of oxytocin in the squirrel monkey may reflect differences in brain oxytocin receptor density associated with the higher concentrations of testosterone in the dominant animal. Alternatively, the status-related effects may depend on the conditioned behavioral differences associated with social organization.},

abstract = {Oxytocin receptors in the nucleus accumbens have been implicated in the regulation of alloparental behavior and pair bond formation in the socially monogamous prairie vole. Oxytocin receptor density in the nucleus accumbens is positively correlated with alloparenting in juvenile and adult female prairie voles, and oxytocin receptor antagonist infused into the nucleus accumbens blocks this behavior. Furthermore, prairie voles have higher densities of oxytocin receptors in the accumbens than nonmonogamous rodent species, and blocking accumbal oxytocin receptors prevents mating-induced partner preference formation. Here we used adeno-associated viral vector gene transfer to examine the functional relationship between accumbal oxytocin receptor density and social behavior in prairie and meadow voles. Adult female prairie voles that overexpress oxytocin receptor in the nucleus accumbens displayed accelerated partner preference formation after cohabitation with a male, but did not display enhanced alloparental behavior. However, partner preference was not facilitated in nonmonogamous meadow voles by introducing oxytocin receptor into the nucleus accumbens. These data confirm a role for oxytocin receptor in the accumbens in the regulation of partner preferences in female prairie voles, and suggest that oxytocin receptor expression in the accumbens is not sufficient to promote partner preferences in nonmonogamous species. These data are the first to demonstrate a direct relationship between oxytocin receptor density in the nucleus accumbens and variation in social attachment behaviors. Thus, individual variation in oxytocin receptor expression in the striatum may contribute to natural diversity in social behaviors.},

However, the types of behaviors that are influenced by this hormone are constrained by the species in question and the social organization that a particular species exhibits. Therefore, the present experiments investigated behaviors regulated by oxytocin in a eusocial mammalian species by using the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber). In Experiment 1, adult non-breeding mole-rats were given intraperitoneal injections of either oxytocin (1. mg/kg or 10. mg/kg) or saline on alternate days. Animals were then returned to their colony and behavior was recorded for minutes 15-30 post-injection. Both doses of oxytocin increased huddling behavior during this time period. In Experiment 2, animals received intraperitoneal injections of either oxytocin (1. mg/kg), an oxytocin-receptor antagonist (0.1. mg/kg), a cocktail of oxytocin and the antagonist, or saline across 4 testing days in a counterbalanced design. Animals were placed in either a 2-chamber arena with a familiar conspecific or in a small chamber with 1. week old pups from their home colony and behaviors were recorded for minutes 15-30 post-injection. Oxytocin increased investigation of, and time spent in close proximity to, a familiar conspecific; these effects were blocked by the oxytocin antagonist. No effects were seen on pup-directed behavior. These data suggest that oxytocin is capable of modulating affiliative-like behavior in this eusocial species. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The stress axis plays a vital role in the endocrine system and is a critical component adapting mammals to particular habitat pressures. It is subject to both individual activational and organizational plasticity as well as to evolutionary modification. To illustrate, I examine the suite of traits of the stress axis associated with breeding frequency in male mammals, which varies in a continuum from semelparity to iteroparity. During the breeding season, males in species at the semelparous end of the continuum exhibit high concentrations of free corticosteroids, low concentrations of glucocorticoid-binding protein, a failure of the negative feedback system, a gonadal axis that is not inhibited by high corticosteroid concentrations, and immunosuppression. Iteroparous species exhibit the opposite traits. The evolutionary constraints selecting for the former may partially be related to phylogeny (in marsupials) as well as to an interaction of the restrictions imposed by the environment on female reproduction, the mating system, the high costs of reproduction, and the low adult survival during the nonbreeding season.},

abstract = {A genetical mathematical model is described which allows for interactions between relatives on one another's fitness. Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named “inclusive fitness”. Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships. Some artificialities of the model are discussed.},

Exclusively oxytocin binding sites were detected in view of the high affinity of the [125I]-labelled oxytocin antagonist for oxytocin binding sites and the negligible affinity for the vasopressin liver (V1) and kidney (V2) receptor types. The putative oxytocin receptors were abundantly present in several brain regions, where previously discrimination between oxytocin and vasopressin binding was difficult, i.e. the olfactory nucleus, the islands of Calleja, the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, the central amygdaloid nucleus and the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus. In addition oxytocin receptors were demonstrated in other areas, such as the taenia tecta, dorsolateral caudate putamen, ventral pallidum, accumbens, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, thalamic paraventricular nucleus, lateral, basolateral and medial amygdala, the dorsal subiculum, perirhinal cortex and the amygdaloid-hippocampal area. The high affinity and the low detection threshold of this [125I]-labelled oxytocin antagonist permitted identification of oxytocin receptors in new regions such as the ventral part of the lateral septum, medial septum, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and the olive nuclei in the brain stem.},

abstract = {Basal density and estrogen induction of oxytocin binding sites in limbic and hypothalamic structures of the rat brain were investigated by semi-quantitative autoradiography following chronic administration of dexamethasone or progesterone. The selective oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2, Thr4, Tyr-NH9 2] ornithine-vasotocin was used as a ligand for oxytocin binding sites. Estrogen administration increased ligand binding in all sites investigated. Dexamethasone treatment significantly increased ligand binding in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral ventral septum and amygdala to an extent which was comparable to that of estradiol alone. In the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus, dexamethasone significantly decreased basal levels of oxytocin binding. Estrogen administration subsequent to dexamethasone failed to cause a further increase in oxytocin binding in all structures investigated. Chronic progesterone treatment significantly increased basal oxytocin receptor density in the limbic structures, decreased it in the ventromedial nucleus, and prevented estrogen-induced increases in ligand binding in all areas studied with the exception of the medial preoptic area. These findings demonstrate that, in addition to gonadal steroids, glucocorticoids differentially and site-specifically modulate cerebral oxytocin binding sites. The evidence for glucocorticoid and gestagen influences on oxytocin receptors and their inducibility by estrogen may be relevant to the understanding of mechanisms leading to impairment of oxytocin-related behaviours. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {Animal temperament describes behavioural differences between individuals that are consistent across time and contexts. Variation in animal temperament is rapidly gaining interest and attention within behavioural and evolutionary ecology. If we are to understand the causes and consequences of temperament variation within and between populations we need to determine the selection pressures that affect temperament in natural environments. To date, however, the vast majority of temperament studies have been carried out on captive-bred individuals. This review highlights potential problems that arise from using captive animals to elucidate the ecological and evolutionary functions of temperament in wild populations. For example, development, learning and environmental variability can all affect behaviour. Thus, both environment and gene-by environment interactions can affect the fitness functions of different temperaments, and hence selection. We stress the need for measurements of repeatability and heritability, and the importance of biological and ecological validation of temperament tests in wild animals. We describe the limited evidence from wild populations of the fitness consequences of temperament variation, and the use of intra- and inter-specific comparisons to prove adaptation. To identify multiple axes of behavioural variation, and how these interact with environments that vary spatially and temporally, we need long-term studies on wild populations - yet few studies of this nature currently exist. Finally, and perhaps counter-intuitively, we suggest that there is much to be gained from incorporating some of the approaches and statistics employed in the much longer established field of human personality. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Chicks of altricial birds may perceive predation risk by acoustic cues produced by predators. This capacity involves changes to a less conspicuous behavior to avoid being detected and predated. However, little is known about the physiological mechanisms underlying this capacity. Potential mechanisms may involve corticosterone and testosterone, two hormones related to begging, an acoustic signal, which could be used by predators to locate and predate the nest. However, given the species-specificity of this relationship, it is difficult to make particular predictions. We manipulated perceived risk of nest predation in the common blackbird (Turdus merula) and analyzed nestlings' plasma levels of these hormones to look for nest predation risk effects. Our experimental manipulation showed hormonal changes in response to nest predation risk. Chicks under a high risk of nest predation reduced their corticosterone plasma levels but increased their testosterone levels in comparison with nestlings exposed to a low nest predation risk. We explain our results as mechanisms to reduce begging activity and discuss them within the framework of hormonal modifications in developing animals. These findings highlight the importance of studying nest predation from the unusually considered chick perspective and underlined the benefits from including physiological variables in the study of predator–prey interactions.},

abstract = {Positive social interactions and social support may protect against various forms of mental and physical illness, although the mechanisms for these effects are not well identified. The socially monogamous prairie vole, which – like humans – forms social bonds and displays high levels of parasympathetic activity, has provided a useful model for investigating neurobiological systems that mediate the consequences of sociality. In the present study, adult female prairie voles were exposed to social isolation or continued pairing with a female sibling (control conditions) for 4 weeks. During weeks 3 and 4 of this period, animals were administered oxytocin (20$\mu$g/50$\mu$l, SC) or saline vehicle (50$\mu$l, SC) daily for a total of 14 days. In Experiment 1, autonomic parameters were recorded during and following isolation or pairing. Isolation (vs. pairing) significantly increased basal heart rate (HR) and reduced HR variability and vagal regulation of the heart; these changes in isolated animals were prevented with oxytocin administration. In Experiment 2, behaviors relevant to depression [sucrose intake and swimming in the forced swim test (FST)] were measured as a function of isolation. Isolation reduced sucrose intake and increased immobility in the FST; these behaviors also were prevented by oxytocin. Administration of oxytocin did not significantly alter cardiac, autonomic or behavioral responses of paired animals. These findings support the hypothesis that oxytocinergic mechanisms can protect against behavioral and cardiac dysfunction in response to chronic social stressors, and can provide insight into social influences on behavior and autonomic function in humans.},

In the male Syrian hamster, these signals are integrated in nuclei of the medial extended amygdala, where olfactory and vomeronasal system transmission is modulated by populations of androgen- and estrogen-sensitive neurons. Evidence from behavioral changes following lesions and from immediate early gene expression supports the hypothesis that the medial extended amygdala and medial preoptic area belong to a circuit that functions selectively in male sexual behavior. However, accumulated behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neuroendocrine data in hamsters, other rodents, and other mammals indicate that this circuit is embedded in a larger integrated network that controls not only male mating behavior, but female sexual behavior, parental behavior, and various forms of aggression. In this context, perhaps an individual animal's social responses can be more eaisly understood as a repertoire of closely interrelated, hormone-regulated behaviors, shaped by development and experience and modulated acutely by the environmental signals and the hormonal milieu of the brain.},

Subchronic phencyclidine (PCP) administration (2 mg/kg/day, 14 days, i.p.) significantly reduced the density of V1a receptor binding sites, labeled by an [125I]-Linear AVP antagonist, in several brain regions. Subchronic treatment with PCP or MK-801 (0.13 mg/kg/day, 14 days, i.p.) impaired social interactions in rats, as has been previously reported. These results suggest that NMDA antagonists have modulatory effects on the central vasopressinergic system and social interaction.},

abstract = {Petrie et al. (1991) demonstrated a correlation between the degree of elaboration of peacocks' trains and their mating success, and also showed that this correlation occurred because females preferred to mate with the male that had the most elaborate train of those sampled on the lek. Although these data suggest that female choice is responsible for non-random mating in this species, they do not conclusively show that train morphology is the cue that females respond to, because they do not rule out the possible influence of another unidentified variable which is correlated with train elaboration. This paper presents an experimental test of the importance of the peacock's train in determining male mating success. If the number or arrangement of eye-spots in the peacock's train influences mating success, then changing the number of eye-spots should change mating success. This prediction was tested in an experiment where the trains of male peafowl (Pavo cristatus) were manipulated by removing a number of eye-spots between mating seasons.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify the afferent link in the neural pathway which mediates emotional responses coupled to auditory stimuli. We evaluated whether autonomic and behavioral responses elicited by acoustic conditioned emotional stimuli are based on afferent information derived from the auditory cortex or from the auditory thalamic relay station, the medial geniculate nucleus (MG), in rats. The rat auditory cortex was defined through anterograde neuroanatomical tracing studies involving the injection of HRP into MG. Lesions were then placed in the auditory cortex or in MG. After 10 to 20 days the rats were subjected to classical fear conditioning trials involving the pairing of a pure tone with electric footshock. Changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate and the duration of immobilization ("freezing") and drink suppression elicited by presentation during extinction trials (no footshock) of the acoustic conditioned emotional stimulus were measured. Auditory cortex lesions did not affect the magnitude of the mean arterial pressure or heart rate conditioned responses nor the duration of freezing or drink suppression. In contrast, lesions of MG suppressed the magnitude of both the autonomic and somatomotor (behavioral) conditioned emotional responses but did not affect either autonomic or somatic responses elicited by the footshock unconditioned stimulus. Lesions of the inferior colliculus, the primary source of afferent input to MG, replicated the effects of MG lesions. These findings demonstrate that lesions of MG and lower auditory centers, but not lesions of the auditory cortex, block autonomic and behavioral conditioned emotional responses coupled to acoustic stimuli and indicate that subcortical rather than cortical efferents of MG sustain these responses. Our concurrent observation that MG projects to several subcortical areas (central and lateral amygdala; caudate-putamen; ventromedial hypothalamus) involved in emotional behavior and autonomic function suggests hypotheses concerning subsequent links in this emotional processing pathway.},

Because social interactions facilitate the spread of infection among individuals, the ability to recognize and avoid infected and potentially infected individuals is crucial. The neuropeptides oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are involved in mediating various facets of social behavior, including social recognition and responses to salient social threats. Results of studies with rodents have revealed that OT and AVP are also associated with the olfactory-mediated recognition and avoidance of actually or potentially infected individuals. The evidence reviewed here suggests that OT and AVP likely play parallel roles in modulating the recognition and avoidance of socially relevant pathogen threat in both humans and rodents.},

Studies of alarm communication in Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii) have focused on juvenile signalers and receivers; however, adult and juvenile receivers may tailor their response to alarm calls based on different underlying signal parameters and attend differentially to alarm calls broadcast by adult versus juvenile signalers. To examine the potential influence of signaler and receiver age on the perception of response urgency, we presented free-living juvenile and adult S. richardsonii with alarm calls produced by juveniles and adults. Behavioral responses of call recipients were videotaped and analyzed to determine the influence of signaler and receiver age-class. No differences in vigilance response after juvenile- and adult-produced calls were detected for either adult or juvenile receivers. At the proximate level, the absence of any detectable difference in the acoustic attributes of juvenile- versus adult-produced calls may account for the lack of differential response. The absence of any age-dependent productional difference also is consistent with the recently advanced notion of young concealing information regarding their age in their alarm signals.},

abstract = {Vomeronasal stem cells are generated throughout the life of a mouse and differentiate into neurons that express one vomeronasal type 1 (V1r), one or two vomeronasal type 2 (V2r), or one olfactory receptor. Vomeronasal stem cells can be induced to differentiate into neurons by treatment with lipocalins from mouse urine or by epigenetic modification following treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors. An important question is, do chemosensory signals, modify the detection capabilities of the vomeronasal organ and affect behaviour. Rearing mice in the presence of urine (and its pheromonal signals) derived from a different mouse strain, affected the behavioural preference for non-kin which were accompanied by changes in vomeronasal receptor expression. Significant changes in the expression of vomeronasal V1r, V2r and olfactory receptors, major urinary proteins, and a number of genes thought to be involved in transcriptional regulation were also observed following urine treatment. These results suggest that modification of a mouse's urinary environment may exert epigenetic effects on developing vomeronasal neurons, which modify the type of vomeronasal receptors that are expressed. This may provide a mechanism by which environmental changes are able to modify the detection capabilities of the vomeronasal organ to respond optimally to the most likely social environment that a mouse will encounter when mature. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 DOI 10.1007/s10519-011-9523-9.},

In the ventromedial and premammillary nuclei, the density of the binding was lower in the females than in the males. The effect of castration and of testosterone replacement was assessed in males. Two distinct effects were observed. Orchidectomy diminished significantly the vasopressin binding in the ventromedial nucleus, an effect which was prevented by implantation of a mini-pump releasing testosterone. On the contrary, in the premammillary nucleus no significant differences were noticed following castration and testosterone treatment. In addition, vasopressin immunoreactivity was examined in males, in females and in castrated males. No sex differences were evident. However, in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the lateral septal nucleus, castration decreased vasopressin immunoreac-tivity in either sex. This effect of castration was prevented by testosterone. Vasopressin immunoreactivity was detected neither in the ventromedial nor in the premammillary hypothalamic nuclei. Our observations suggest that, in adult Siberian hamster premammillary nucleus, the expression of vasopressin receptors is not controlled by gonadal steroids but is sex related and could be induced during fetal or early postnatal life.},

Until now, the principal method ofstudying neurogenesis has been to inject either tritiated thymidine or 5?-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) intraperitoneally followed byautoradiographic or immunohistochemical detection methods respectively. However, such exogenous markers may produce toxiceffects. Our objective was to determine whether Ki-67, a nuclear protein expressed in all phases of the cell cycle except the restingphase, can be used as an alternative, endogenous marker. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined Ki-67 and BrdU expressionpattern in rats. Ki-67 was expressed within the proliferative zone of the dentate gyrus and its expression pattern mimicked that ofBrdU when examined soon after exogenous BrdU administration. Quantitative comparison of BrdU and Ki-67-positive cellsshowed 50{\%} higher numbers of the latter when examined 24 h after the BrdU injection. This was expected, since BrdU can beincorporated into DNA only during the S-phase of the mitotic process, whereas Ki-67 is expressed for its whole duration.Experimental increases (by ischemia) or reductions (by radiation) in the number of mitotic cells produced parallel changes in BrdUand Ki-67 signals. Thus, Ki-67 is an effective mitotic marker and has most of the benefits of BrdU and none of the costs. This studyprovides evidence for Ki-67 to be used as a marker of proliferation in the initial phase of adult neurogenesis. {\#}},

abstract = {The rodent vomeronasal system plays a critical role in mediating pheromone-evoked social and sexual behaviors. Recent studies of the anatomical and molecular architecture of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and of its synaptic target, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), have suggested that unique features underlie vomeronasal sensory processing. However, the neuronal representation of pheromonal information leading to specific behavioral and endocrine responses has remained largely unexplored due to the experimental difficulty of precise stimulus delivery to the VNO. To determine the basic rules of information processing in the vomeronasal system, we developed a unique preparation that allows controlled and repeated stimulus delivery to the VNO and combined this approach with multisite recordings of neuronal activity in the AOB. We found that urine, a well-characterized pheromone source in mammals, as well as saliva, activates AOB neurons in a manner that reliably encodes the donor animal's sexual and genetic status. We also identified a significant fraction of AOB neurons that respond robustly and selectively to predator cues, suggesting an expanded role for the vomeronasal system in both conspecific and interspecific recognition. Further analysis reveals that mixed stimuli from distinct sources evoke synergistic responses in AOB neurons, thereby supporting the notion of integrative processing of chemosensory information.},

abstract = {Mammals can perceive and discriminate myriad volatile chemicals as having a distinct odor. Odorants are initially detected by odorant receptors (ORs) on olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the nose. In the mouse, each OSN expresses one of {\_}1000 different OR genes. Although OSNs and their expressed ORs constitute the fundamental units of sensory input to the brain, a comprehensive understanding of how they encode odor identities is still lacking. To gain a broader and more detailed understanding of odorant recognition and odor coding at this level, we tested the responses of 3000 mouse OSNs to 125 odorants with diverse structures and perceived odors. These studies revealed extraordinary diversity, but also bias, in odorant recognition by the OSN, and thus OR, repertoire. They indicate that most OSNs are narrowly tuned to detect a subset of odorants with related structures and often related odors, but that the repertoire also includes broadly tuned components. Strikingly, the vast majority of odorants activated a unique set of OSNs, usually two or more in combination. The resulting combinatorial codes varied in size among odorants and sometimes contained both narrowly and broadly tuned components. While many OSNs recognized multiple odorants, some appeared specific for a given pheromone or other animalassociated compound, or for one or more odorants with a particular odor quality, raising the possibility that signals derived from some OSNs and ORs might elicit an innate behavior or convey a specific odor quality. {\textcopyright} 2011 the authors.},

abstract = {Oxytocin (OT) is a nine amino acid peptide synthesized in hypothalamic cells which project either to the neurohypophysis or to sites within the central nervous system. Although neurohypophyseal OT release has long been associated with uterine contraction and milk ejection, the function of intracerebral OT remains unclear. On the basis of behavioral, cellular, and comparative studies, this review suggests that brain OT influences the formation of social bonds. The first part of this review examines evidence linking central OT to several forms of affiliation. Central administration of OT induces maternal and reproductive behaviors in rats primed with gonadal steroids. OT antagonists and hypothalamic lesions block the initiation of maternal and reproductive behaviors but have no effects on these behaviors once established. Our new studies in rat pups demonstrate that central OT selectively decreases the separation response, an effect which mimics social contact. These studies of parental, reproductive, and attachment behaviors suggest that exogenous OT has "prosocial" effects and that endogenous OT may be essential for initiating social interaction. In a second series of experiments, we investigated the cellular mechanisms for OT's effects on social behavior by means of autoradiographic receptor binding. In the rat forebrain, OT receptors are expressed in several limbic regions believed to be involved in the integration of sensory processing. The regulation of these receptors is surprisingly resistant to either ablation of OT cells or repeated central administration of OT. However, receptors in two regions, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN), appear selectively induced by exogenous or endogenous increases in gonadal steroids. At parturition, binding to OT receptors increases 84{\%} in the BNST, and at estrus, binding increases 35{\%} in the VMN. These results demonstrate that physiologic changes in gonadal steroids can alter receptor expression in anatomically discrete target fields and thereby direct responsiveness to endogenous neuropeptide release. A model for OT's effects on social behavior is proposed, which relies on the heterologous regulation of the brain OT receptor. A third series of experiments tested the hypothesis that brain OT influences affiliation by comparing prairie and montane voles, two closely related species with dichotomous systems of social organization. Although no differences appear in the presynaptic expression of the neuropeptide, OT receptors are distributed in complementary patterns in the two species. In the highly affiliative prairie vole, receptors are most evident in the BNST and one of its primary afferents, the lateral amygdala, highlighting a circuit previously implicated in maternal behaviour. In the asocial montane vole receptors are absent in these regions. At parturition, when the female montane vole first manifests maternal behavior, the expression of OT receptors changes in the direction of the pattern observed in the highly parental prairie vole. The specificity of these findings is supported by (1) studies in other species with similar behavioral differences and (2) the failure to find concurrent species differences in the distribution of receptors for several other neurotransmitters. These various behavioral, receptor autoradiographic, and comparative studies all provide evidence that brain OT systems, via alterations in receptor number and distribution, may influence the expression of social behavior. As OT is an exclusively mammalian neuropeptide, this central neuroendocrine system may have evolved relatively recently to promote selective aspects of social bond formation. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Our study combined a mitochondrial cytochrome b phylogeny with cranial measurements from giant pouched rats collected across sub-Saharan Africa. The mitochondrial phylogeny resolves two West African clades and a clade with east and central Africa representatives. This last clade can be further divided into four subclades. Altogether they represent six species (Cricetomys gambianus, Cricetomys ansorgei, Cricetomys emini, and three undescribed taxa) that can be distinguished on the basis of their mitochondrial DNA sequences and craniometry. In the absence of adequate craniometric data the existence of Cricetomys kivuensis cannot be confirmed by our data. Our combined molecular and craniometric data allowed us to broadly delineate the distribution ranges of the detected species. Cricetomys gambianus occurs in the savannah and forest clearings of West Africa. Cricetomys ansorgei is distributed in the savannah of East and southern Africa. Cricetomys emini, as currently recognized across the Guineo-Congolian forest of Africa, is shown to be diphyletic. Cricetomys sp. 1, a separate operational taxonomic unit closely resembling C. emini, occurs in the forest zone of West Africa. An undescribed sister-species of C. ansorgei, Cricetomys sp. 2, occurs in the forest of Central Africa along the left bank of the Congo River. Cricetomys sp. 3 occurs on the right bank of the Congo River from Cameroon to the Republic of Congo, whereas the true C. emini also occurs on the right bank of the Congo River but appears to be restricted to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Cranial phenotype within the genus tends to conform to ecological zonation (either forest or savannah) rather than to phylogenetic affiliation of the species concerned, suggesting that diversifying selection across environmental gradients could be responsible for biological diversification within the genus.},

abstract = {The neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin and their receptors have been implicated in elements of mammalian social behavior such as attachment to mates and offspring, but their potential role in mediating other types of social relationships remains largely unknown. We performed receptor autoradiography to assess whether forebrain oxytocin receptor (OTR) or vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) distributions differed with social structure in two closely related and ecologically similar species of South American rodents, the colonial tuco-tuco (Ctenomys sociabilis) and the Patagonian tuco-tuco (Ctenomys haigi). Long-term field studies have revealed that C. haigi is solitary, whereas C. sociabilis is social and provides a model of female-based group living. Our analyses revealed marked differences in OTR and V1aR distributions between these species. For example, only C. sociabilis had OTR binding in the piriform cortex and thalamus and V1aR binding in the olfactory bulbs. In contrast, C. haigi exhibited dramatically higher levels of OTR binding throughout the lateral septum and hippocampus. More generally, the group-living C. sociabilis exhibited a pattern of nucleus accumbens OTR and ventral pallidum V1aR binding different from that associated with the formation of opposite-sex pair bonds in microtine rodents. Higher binding in the central nucleus of the amygdala of C. sociabilis was consistent with the hypothesis that formation of social groups in C. sociabilis may be facilitated by reduced social anxiety. Low OTR binding in the lateral septum might also be a permissive factor for group living in C. sociabilis. Future studies will expand on these analyses to explore interspecific differences in ctenomyid receptor binding patterns in a phylogenetic context.},

During test sessions, each rat located human targets more often than it located similar-sized inanimate targets on which it had not previously been trained and spent more time within 1 m of the human target than within 1 m of the other targets. Overall, the rats found humans, plastic bags containing clothes, and plastic bags without clothes on 83{\%}, 37{\%}, and 11{\%} of trials, respectively.

The availability of selective iodinated ligands with high specific activity allowed us to develop the histoautoradiographical technique and to reinvestigate at the microscopic scale the distribution of these sites in the hypothalamus. Most oxytocin binding sites were localized in delimited nuclei, e.g., the medial preoptic, the ventromedial, the ventral premammillary, the supramammillary, and the medial mammillary nuclei. In addition, a weak diffuse specific labeling occurred in the medial preoptic and the anterior hypothalamic areas. The vasopressin binding sites (of the Vla type) were detected in delimited nuclei, e.g., the suprachiasmatic, the stigmoid, and the arcuate nuclei, but they were also diffusely distributed in the lateral hypothalamic and the dorsochiasmaUc areas. The locations of neurohypophysial peptides binding sites detected by light microscopy are compared with those previously obtained by film autoradiography.},

Additionally, a microdialysis administration technique was used to administer synthetic AVP (0.2 or 2.0 ng) or its V1 receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (5.0 ng) into the mediolateral septum concomitantly with the behavioral test. Untreated HO-DI rats showed an impaired social recognition compared with untreated Long-Evans rats. A similarly impaired performance was observed after V1 receptor antagonist treatment of Long-Evans rats. Microdialysis administration of synthetic AVP, on the other hand, significantly improved social recognition in both rat strains. The data suggest that endogenous AVP in the septal brain area is critically involved in the acquisition, storage, and/or recall of olfactory cues in rats.},

abstract = {In the tungara frog, Physalaemus pustulosus, males alter calling behavior with changes in their social environment, adding 'chucks' to their advertisement calls in response to the calls of conspecific males. Other studies demonstrate that adding chucks increases the attractiveness of calls to females but also increases the risk of bat predation. In the current study, subcutaneous injections of the neuropeptide hormone arginine vasotocin (AVT) significantly increased chuck production in male tungara frogs. The effects of AVT on chuck production did not depend on the presence of playback stimuli, suggesting that AVT increased either the males' general motivation to produce chucks or their responsiveness to the calls of distant males. Injections of AVT also increased the probability that males would call and decreased the latency to call after injection, supporting the hypothesis that AVT influences motivation to call. Finally, AVT inhibited a drop in call rate after the termination of a playback stimulus and increased call rate at a lower dose of AVT. The effects of AVT on chucks and call rate appear to be independent of each other, as there was no correlation between change in chuck production and change in call rate in individual males. We conclude that AVT may play an important role in socially-mediated call changes that result from competition for mates. The behavioral changes induced by AVT might increase a male's attractiveness to females, and also may be consistent with an aggressive response to another tungara frog male.},

abstract = {Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) and their receptors are very similar in structure. As a result, at least some of the effects of these peptides may be the result of crosstalk between their canonical receptors. The present study investigated this hypothesis by determining whether the induction of flank marking, a form of social communication in Syrian hamsters, by OT is mediated by the OT receptor or the AVP V1a receptor. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of OT or AVP induced flank marking in a dose-dependent manner although the effects of AVP were approximately 100 times greater than those of OT. Injections of highly selective V1a receptor agonists but not OT receptor agonists induced flank marking, and V1a receptor antagonists but not OT receptor antagonists significantly inhibited the ability of OT to induce flank marking. Lastly, injection of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone ($\alpha$-MSH), a peptide that stimulates OT but not AVP release, significantly increased odor-induced flank marking, and these effects were blocked by a V1a receptor antagonist. These data demonstrate that OT induces flank marking by activating AVP V1a and not OT receptors, suggesting that the V1a receptor should be considered to be an OT receptor as well as an AVP receptor.},

abstract = {We have investigated the distribution of vasopressin binding sites in the brain of male and female adult mice using a radio-iodinated ligand and film autoradiography. Vasopressin receptors were uncovered in various regions of the brain including the basal nucleus of Meynert, the substantia innominata, the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, the substantia nigra pars compacta and the hypoglossal nucleus. A sex-related difference in the expression of vasopressin receptors was seen in the medial preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus corresponding to the rat sexually dimorphic nucleus in the rat and in the hypothalamic mammillary nuclei. In both structures the autoradiographic labeling is more intense in females than in males. These observations confirm that vasopressin binding sites are present in the hypothalamic preoptic area of most species examined so far and that sex-related expression of neuropeptide receptors could trigger sex-related behavioral differences.},

abstract = {Two inbred rat lines have been developed that show either high (HAB) or low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior. The behavioral phenotype correlates with arginine vasopressin (AVP) expression at the level of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), but not supraoptic nucleus, with HAB animals overexpressing the neuropeptide in both magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the PVN. We detected a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AVP locus that differ between the HAB and LAB animals, two of which were embedded in cis-regulatory elements. The HAB-specific allele of the AVP gene promoter occurs in 1.5{\%} of outbred Wistar rats and is more transcriptionally active in vivo, as revealed by allele-specific transcription studies in cross-mated HAB/LAB F1 animals. Interestingly, one specific SNP [A(-1276)G] conferred reduced binding of the transcriptional repressor CArG binding factor A (CBF-A) in the HAB allele, the consequent differential regulation of the AVP promoter resulting in an overexpression of AVP in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, CBF-A is highly coexpressed in AVP-containing neurons of the PVN supporting an important role for regulation of AVP gene expression in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate a role for an AVP gene polymorphism and CBF-A in elevated AVP expression in the PVN of HAB rats likely to contribute to their behavioral and neuroendocrine phenotype.},

abstract = {Studies in several species of rodents show that arginine vasopressin (AVP) acting through a V1A receptor facilitates offensive aggression, i.e., the initiation of attacks and bites, whereas serotonin (5-HT) acting through a 5-HT1B receptor inhibits aggressive responding. One area of the CNS that seems critical for the organization of aggressive behavior is the basolateral hypothalamus, particularly the anterior hypothalamic region. The present studies examine the neuroanatomical and neurochemical interaction between AVP and 5-HT at the level of the anterior hypothalamus (AH) in the control of offensive aggression in Syrian golden hamsters. First, specific V1A and 5-HT1B binding sites in the AH are shown by in vitro receptor autoradiography. The binding for each neurotransmitter colocalizes with a dense field of immunoreactive AVP and 5-HT fibers and putative terminals. Putative 5-HT synapses on AVP neurons in the area of the AH are identified by double-staining immunocytochemistry and laser scanning confocal microscopy. These morphological data predispose a functional interaction between AVP and 5-HT at the level of the AH. When tested for offensive aggression in a resident/intruder paradigm, resident hamsters treated with fluoxetine, a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, have significantly longer latencies to bite and bite fewer times than vehicle-treated controls. Conversely, AVP microinjections into the AH significantly shorten the latency to bite and increase biting attacks. The action of microinjected AVP to increase offensive aggression is blocked by the pretreatment of hamsters with fluoxetine. These data suggest that 5-HT inhibits fighting, in part, by antagonizing the aggression-promoting action of the AVP system.},

abstract = {Sex ratio alterations related to environmental factors occur in several mammals, but no mechanism has been identified to explain the adjustment. Intrauterine position (IUP) may provide the context in which such alterations occur. Previous studies on house mice and gerbils reveal that the position of a fetus in the uterus in relation to the sex of its neighbors influences its later anatomy, physiology, and behavior. The anogenital distance (AGD) of females located between two males (2M) is longer than that of females not between two males (OM). We have found that the IUP, as determined by cesarean section and by an index of the AGD, correlates with the sex ratio of the litters produced by female mice. The sex ratio of the first litter born to 2M females was 58{\%} males, for 1M females was 51{\%} males and for OM females was 42{\%} males. The effect on sex ratio continues into the second litter. The number of pups produced by mothers of different IUPs in her first two litters did not differ, suggesting that the sex ratio adjustment occurs prior to parturition. These results provide a basis for the natural variability observed in sex ratios of litter-bearing mammals and suggest that one or more intrauterine mechanisms may be responsible for environmentally related sex ratio alterations.},

abstract = {Female deer mice were exposed to a short day (SD, 6L:18D) photoperiod beginning during 1 of 3 stages of life. In the first experiment, exposure to SD during adulthood resulted in a minimal disruption of reproductive condition; many females bore 2 litters after the onset of this treatment. In the second experiment, females reared on SD from weaning matured normally, as measured by vaginal introitus; however, vaginal closure occurred in approximately one-half of these females by 9 weeks of age. In the third experiment, females were born of mothers housed on either an SD or a long day photoperiod, and were continued on the maternal photoperiod until 6 weeks of postnatal age. The SD photoperiod markedly inhibited reproductive maturation as measured by vaginal patency, ovarian weight, and uterine weight. A comparison of reproductive organ weights and vaginal condition provided evidence for the validity of the latter measure as an index of reproductive state. As assayed by the present testing procedure, the sensitivity of the reproductive system to photoperiod decreases as a function of age in female deer mice.},

abstract = {Trust and betrayal of trust are ubiquitous in human societies. Recent behavioral evidence shows that the neuropeptide oxytocin increases trust among humans, thus offering a unique chance of gaining a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying trust and the adaptation to breach of trust. We examined the neural circuitry of trusting behavior by combining the intranasal, double-blind, administration of oxytocin with fMRI. We find that subjects in the oxytocin group show no change in their trusting behavior after they learned that their trust had been breached several times while subjects receiving placebo decrease their trust. This difference in trust adaptation is associated with a specific reduction in activation in the amygdala, the midbrain regions, and the dorsal striatum in subjects receiving oxytocin, suggesting that neural systems mediating fear processing (amygdala and midbrain regions) and behavioral adaptations to feedback information (dorsal striatum) modulate oxytocin's effect on trust. These findings may help to develop deeper insights into mental disorders such as social phobia and autism, which are characterized by persistent fear or avoidance of social interactions.},

abstract = {The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is intimately involved in the development of conditional fear. Converging lines of evidence support a role for this region in the storage of fear memory but do not rule out a time-limited role in the memory consolidation. To examine this issue, we assessed the stability of BLA contribution to fear memories acquired across the adult lifetime of rats. Fear conditioning consisted of 10 tone-shock pairings in one context (remote memory), followed 16 months later by 10 additional tone-shock pairings with a novel tone in a novel context (recent memory). Twenty-four hours after recent training, rats were given NMDA or sham lesions of the BLA. Contextual and tone freezing were independently assessed in individual test sessions. Sham-lesioned rats showed high and comparable levels of freezing across all context and tone tests. In contrast, BLA-lesioned rats displayed robust freezing deficits across both recent and remote tests. Subsequent open-field testing revealed no effects of BLA lesions on activity patterns in a dark open field or during bright light exposure. Lesioned rats were able to reacquire normal levels of context-specific freezing after an overtraining procedure (76 unsignaled shocks). Together, these findings indicate that BLA lesions do not disrupt freezing behavior by producing hyperactivity, an inability to suppress behavior, or an inability to freeze. Rather, the consistent pattern of freezing deficits at both training-to-lesion intervals supports a role for the BLA in the permanent storage of fear memory.},

abstract = {Inbreeding depression has been studied extensively in many animals, but the potential of `social facilitation' (a response to the presence of conspecifics in the environment) to influence reproduction has received little attention. Studies of reproductive output in freshwater hermaphrodite snails have implicated inbreeding depression, but never social facilitation, in the reduced reproductive output of isolated compared with paired/grouped snails. In this experiment, isolated, self-fertilizing Biomphalaria glabrata snails had reduced reproductive output compared with paired, predominantly cross-fertilizing snails. However, the reproductive output of control snails (paired, but prevented from cross-fertilizing) was similar to that of paired, cross-fertilizing snails, suggesting that the low reproductive output of snails in isolation was not simply due to inbreeding depression with self-fertilization. I suggest that an absence of social facilitation, caused by deprivation of social communication as a result of isolation, may play a role in reducing reproductive output of isolated B. glabrata, and that future studies of inbreeding depression using isolated and paired/grouped hermaphrodite snails should be designed to control for possible effects of social facilitation.},

abstract = {Centrally administered arginine vasopressin induces the formation of partner preferences in male prairie voles ( Microtus ochrogaster). The expression of many vasopressin-regulated behaviours is testosterone dependent. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that early exposure to gonadal steroids are necessary to establish the typical response of adult male prairie voles to exogenous vasopressin, predicting that adult males which were castrated neonatally would not form partner preferences in response to centrally administered vasopressin. We also examined the effect of neonatal castration on the expression of vasopressin (V1a) receptors. Voles were castrated on the day of birth (NEOCAST), sham-castrated on the day of birth (NEOSHAM) or castrated as adults (ADULTCAST). With the exception of one group of neonatal sham males (NEOSHAM CON), which served as a control for the effects of vasopressin, as adults, all males received a 1-µl intracerebroventricular injection of vasopressin (100 ng) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, 2 weeks before testing, one group of neonatally castrated males received an implant of testosterone propionate (NEOCAST + TP). Between 60 and 90 days of age, an internal cannula was placed in the lateral cerebral ventricle and, 24 h later, males were injected with vasopressin. Subsequently, after an additional 15 min, males were cohabitated with a female ‘partner' for 1 h. Immediately following cohabitation, males were placed in a Y-shaped partner preference test apparatus for 3 h, in which the male had access to the ‘partner' and a novel female, ‘stranger.' Time spent with the partner versus the stranger was compared within and between treatments. The results were found to support our hypothesis as the NEOSHAM and ADULTCAST males formed partner preferences, spending more time with the partner, and they spent significantly more time with their partner than did NEOSHAM CON, NEOCAST or NEOCAST + TP males. Replacement of testosterone in neonatally castrated males did not restore partner preference formation in response to vasopressin in adult males. Finally, neonatal castration did not affect the distribution of V1a receptors.},

abstract = {In the present study, adult Long-Evans rats were exposed either to natural conspecific aversive 22-kHz vocalizations or to artificial call-like stimuli with comparable frequency-temporal features, followed by c-Fos immunohistochemistry. The natural 22-kHz vocalizations was either played from a recording or produced by a foot-shocked animal located nearby (live vocalizations). In comparison with controls (non-exposed animals), c-Fos immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the inferior colliculus (IC), auditory cortex (AC), periaqueductal grey (PAG), basolateral amygdala (BA), and hippocampus (Hip) of rats exposed to either live or recorded 22-kHz natural vocalizations. Exposure to live natural vocalizations of the foot-shocked animal resulted in a similar pattern of c-Fos activity, as did exposure to the playback of the natural vocalizations. In contrast to this, foot-shocked rats (emitting the 22-kHz vocalizations) had the c-Fos positivity increased markedly in the PAG and only slightly in the AC. The expression of c-Fos also increased in the IC, AC, and in the PAG in animals exposed to the artificial call-like stimuli, when compared to controls; however, the increase was much less pronounced. In this case, c-Fos expression was not increased in the hippocampus or basolateral amygdala. Interestingly, almost no c-Fos expression was found in the medial nucleus of the geniculate body in any of the experimental groups. These findings suggest that differences exist between the processing of important natural conspecific vocalizations and artificial call-like stimuli with similar frequency-temporal features, and moreover they suggest the specific role of individual brain structures in the processing of such calls.},

abstract = {It has long been known that the behavior of an animal can be affected by odors from another species. Such interspecific effects of odorous compounds (allelochemics) are usually characterized according to who benefits (emitter, receiver, or both) and the odors categorized accordingly (allomones, kairomones, and synomones, respectively), which has its origin in the definition of pheromones, i.e., intraspecific communication via volatile compounds. When considering vertebrates, however, interspecific odor-based effects exist which do not fit well in this paradigm. Three aspects in particular do not encompass all interspecific semiochemical effects: one relates to the innateness of the behavioral response, another to the origin of the odor, and the third to the intent of the message. In this review we focus on vertebrates, and present examples of behavioral responses of animals to odors from other species with specific reference to these three aspects. Searching for a more useful classification of allelochemical effects we examine the relationship between the valence of odors (attractive through to aversive), and the relative contributions of learned and unconditioned (innate) behavioral responses to odors from other species. We propose that these two factors (odor valence and learning) may offer an alternative way to describe the nature of interspecific olfactory effects involving vertebrates compared to the current focus on who benefits.},

It has been proposed that animals make finer odor discriminations at the expense of additional processing time. To test this idea, we measured the relationship between the speed and accuracy of olfactory discrimination in rats. We found that speed of discrimination was independent of odor similarity, as measured by overlap of glomerular activity patterns. Even when pushed to psychophysical limits using mixtures of two odors, rats needed to take only one sniff ({\textless}200 ms at theta frequency) to make a decision of maximum accuracy. These results show that, for the purpose of odor quality discrimination, a fully refined olfactory sensory representation can emerge within a single sensorimotor or theta cycle, suggesting that each sniff can be considered a snapshot of the olfactory world.},

abstract = {According to behavioural ecology theory, sociality evolves when the net benefits of close association with conspecifics exceed the costs. The nature and relative magnitude of the benefits and costs of sociality are expected to vary across species and habitats. When sociality is favoured, animals may form groups that range from small pair-bonded units to huge aggregations. The size and composition of social groups have diverse effects on morphology and behaviour, ranging from the extent of sexual dimorphism to brain size, and the structure of social relationships. This general argument implies that sociality has fitness consequences for individuals. However, for most mammalian species, especially long-lived animals like primates, there are sizable gaps in the chain of evidence that links sociality and social bonds to fitness outcomes. These gaps reflect the difficulty of quantifying the cumulative effects of behavioural interactions on fitness and the lack of information about the nature of social relationships among individuals in most taxa. Here, I review what is known about the reproductive consequences of sociality for mammals.},

abstract = {In litter-bearing mammals, the course of development of male and female fetuses is affected by the presence of other fetuses of the same or opposite sex located nearby within the uterus. The transport of testosterone between rat fetuses was examined by implanting a Silastic capsule containing [3H]testosterone into the amniotic sac of a fetus at either the ovarian or cervical end of a uterine horn on days 19 and 20 of pregnancy. The amount of testosterone that was recovered from the amniotic fluid of other fetuses 12 h later was determined. The amniotic fluid surrounding the adjacent fetus on the cervical side of the implanted fetus contained three times as much [3H]testosterone as did the adjacent fetus on the ovarian side, regardless of where in the uterus the implant was made. The movement of dye injected into the uterine lumen was towards the cervix. Intraluminal fluid movement may thus mediate the greater transport of [3H]testosterone towards the cervix than towards the ovary. Our findings support the hypothesis that transport of testosterone between fetuses occurs across the fetal membranes via diffusion, such that any fetus (male or female) located between male fetuses receives the greatest supplement of testosterone.},

abstract = {Female phenotypic masculinization is a phenomenon widely described among mammals. In species that produce litters, female masculinization occurs in utero during late trimester of pregnancy as consequence of the intrauterine position phenomenon (IUP), affecting morphological, physiological and behavioral traits during adulthood. One morphological trait that is affected by IUP is anogenital distance (AGD) that is utilized as proxy of the female phenotypic masculinization. In rodents, IUP have ecological and behavioral effects including aggressiveness, territory marking, activity level, parental care and sociality. In this work, we evaluated how female masculinization (or feminization) affects aggressive behavior and determines social dominance, which in turn could lead to the structuring of social groups through dominance hierarchy formation in degus. We carried out a laboratory study where we established artificial social groups composed of females with the similar and different AGDs, and recorded all social interactions identifying initiator/recipient in dyad relationships and the nature of each interaction. Female aggression varied depending on the degree of females' masculinization, but only in mixed groups (those composed of females with different AGDs) was a hierarchical relationship observed. Furthermore, dominance hierarchies were constructed mostly on the basis of submissive, rather than aggressive interactions. Finally, female behavioral and morphological masculinization was not due to higher plasma testosterone levels, which would indicate that the masculinization of the female phenotype is the consequence of the organizational effects of steroid hormones during ontogeny. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Social recognition is a fundamental requirement for all forms of social relationships. A majority of studies investigating the neural mechanisms underlying social recognition in rodents have investigated relatively neutral social stimuli such as juveniles or ovariectomized females over short time intervals (e.g., 2h). The present study developed a new testing model to study social recognition among adult males using a potent social stimulus. Flank gland odors are used extensively in social communication in Syrian hamsters and convey important information such as dominance status. We found that the recognition of flank gland odors after a 3min exposure lasted for at least 24h, substantially longer than the recognition of other social cues in rats and mice. Intracerebroventricular injections of OT and AVP prolonged the recognition of flank gland odor for up to 48h. Selective OTR but not V1aR agonists, mimicked these enhancing effects of OT and AVP. Similarly, selective OTR but not V1aR antagonists blocked recognition of the odors after 20min. In contrast, the recognition of non-social stimuli was not blocked by either the OTR or the V1aR antagonists. Our findings suggest both OT and AVP enhance social recognition via acting on OTRs and not V1aRs and that the recognition enhancing effects of OT and AVP are limited to social stimuli.},

abstract = {Intrauterine position (IUP) of female and male fetuses in litter-bearing mammals can affect their physiology, morphology and behavior. The relationship between anogenital distance (AGD) and IUP was used as a bioassay for the degree of exposure of female and male fetuses to hormones in utero. Based on laboratory work in several rodent species, the following predictions were made for house mice (Mus musculus domesticus): (1) female mice should prefer odors from males with larger AGDs because such males are more aggressive, could protect more resources, and are better parents than males with smaller AGDs; (2) male mice should prefer odors from females with smaller AGDs because these females produce more offspring and are better parents than females with larger AGDs. We also tested the prediction that within sexes, mice should avoid odors from mice with larger AGDs because such mice are more aggressive. Responses to odors in traps were used to test these predictions for house mice living in outdoor enclosures using odor-baited traps. Both predictions were confirmed. Furthermore, mice of both sexes tended to avoid odor cues from individuals of the same sex that had larger AGDs, probably to decrease chances of an aggressive encounter that could result in injury.

abstract = {We studied mechanisms responsible for reproductive skew in female Alpine marmots. In each social group, only dominant females produced weaned young although subordinate females had similar body condition, were fertile as indicated by high levels of oestradiol during the mating season, and occasionally started pregnancies. During the period of gestation, dominant females initiated significantly more agonistic interactions against subordinate females, resulting in significantly increased levels of glucocorticoids and decreased levels of progesterone in subordinates. Results suggested that reproductive suppression in female Alpine marmots is mediated by the negative effects of stress (glucocorticoids) on the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The strength of competition between subordinate and dominant females was affected by their relatedness. Dominant females attacked unrelated subordinate females more, whereas amicable behaviour was observed mainly between dominant females and their daughters. These differences could be explained by differences in indirect fitness: related subordinate females benefited from warming the offspring of the dominant female during hibernation. Reproductive suppression was apparently costly for dominant females, because their reproductive success decreased as the number of adult subordinate females in a group increased.

abstract = {Oxytocin neurons have a physiological role in food intake and energy balance. Central administration of oxytocin is powerfully anorexigenic, reducing food intake and meal duration. The central mechanisms underlying this effect of oxytocin have become better understood in the past few years. Parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus project to the caudal brainstem to regulate feeding via autonomic functions including the gastrointestinal vago-vagal reflex. In contrast, magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei release oxytocin from their dendrites to diffuse to distant hypothalamic targets involved in satiety. The ventromedial hypothalamus, for example, expresses a high density of oxytocin receptors but does not contain detectable oxytocin nerve fibers. Magnocellular neurons represent targets for the anorexigenic neuropeptide $\alpha$-melanocyte stimulating hormone. In addition to homeostatic control, oxytocin may also have a role in reward-related feeding. Evidence suggests that oxytocin can selectively suppress sugar intake and that it may have a role in limiting the intake of palatable food by inhibiting the reward pathway.},

abstract = {Male peafowl display to females with erection and movement of their elaborately ornamented train. We hypothesized that the male's concave train serves as a radiator of acoustic signals, and thus examined both the production and perception of acoustic signals associated with these displays in Indian peafowl, Pavo cristatus. We discovered that male train displays produced infrasonic signals, which were perceived by both male and female peafowl. Both males and females responded to a subset of infrasonic signals by increasing the time they spent walking/running and being alert during playbacks relative to baseline controls. Male peafowl also increased rates of vocalization in response to infrasonic signals, but not to audible train-based signals. The apparent intra- and intersexual saliency of these signals suggests that they play a potent role in peafowl social signalling. Infrasonic signals are likely adaptive in the peacock's natural habitat, as they would attenuate minimally as they are propagated through dense vegetation that otherwise would attenuate high frequencies in audible signals and obstruct visual signals.},

abstract = {Social monogamy is a mating strategy rarely employed by mammalian species. Laboratory studies in socially monogamous prairie voles Microtus ochrogaster demonstrate that oxytocin and vasopressin act within the mesolimbic dopamine pathway to facilitate pair-bond formation. Species differences in oxytocin receptor (OTR) and vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) distribution in this pathway are associated with species differences in mating strategy. Here, we characterize the neuroanatomical distribution of OTR and V1aR binding sites in naturally occurring populations of Taiwan voles Microtus kikuchii, which purportedly display social monogamy. Live trapping was conducted at two sites in 2009-2010 and receptor autoradiography for OTR and V1aR was performed on brains from 24 animals. OTR binding in two brain regions where OTR signaling regulates pair-bonding were directly compared with that of prairie voles. Our results show that like prairie voles, Taiwan voles exhibit OTR in the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, claustrum, nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, dorsal lateral septal nucleus, central amygdala and ventromedial hypothalamus. Unlike prairie voles, Taiwan voles exhibit OTR binding in the CA3 field of the hippocampus, as well as the indusium griseum, which has only previously been documented in tuco-tucos Ctenomys haigi, Ctenomys sociabilis, Syrian hamsters Mesocricetus auratus and naked mole-rats Heterocephalus glaber. V1aR binding was present in the ventral pallidum, lateral septum, nucleus basalis, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hippocampus, medial amygdala, and anterior, ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamus. Marked individual differences in V1aR binding were noted in the cingulate cortex and several thalamic nuclei, remarkably similar to prairie voles. While pharmacological studies are needed to determine whether oxytocin and vasopressin are involved in pair-bond formation in this species, our results lay a foundation for future investigations into the role of these neuropeptides in Taiwan vole social behavior.},

abstract = {Monogamous male birds typically allocate less effort to courtship and more to parental behaviour than males of polygynous species. The seasonal pattern of testosterone (T) secretion varies accordingly. Monogamous males exhibit a spring peak in plasma T followed by lower levels during the parental phase, while males of polygynous species continue to court females and maintain T at higher levels. To determine whether testosterone underlies the trade-off between mating and parental effort, we treated male dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) with exogenous T and compared the reproductive success (RS) of T-treated males (T-males) to that of controls. T-males had lower apparent annual RS than controls, probably because elevated T reduced parental care. Nevertheless, annual genetic RS of the treatment groups was similar because (i) T-males suffered fewer losses in genetic RS due to extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs), and (ii) T-males gained more genetic RS through their own EPFs. This is the first hormonal manipulation of an avian phenotype shown to have influenced male RS through EPFs. Together with other studies, it suggests that testosterone may have mediated the evolution of inter- and intraspecific differences in allocation of reproductive effort to mate attraction and parental care.},

abstract = {The neuropeptide oxytocin has been implicated in the regulation of affiliative behavior and maternal responsiveness in several mammalian species. Rodent species vary considerably in the expression of juvenile alloparental behavior. For example, alloparental behavior is spontaneous in juvenile female prairie voles (∼20 days of age), takes 1-3 days of pup exposure to develop in juvenile rats, and is nearly absent in juvenile mice and meadow voles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that species differences in pup responsiveness in juvenile rodents are associated with oxytocin receptor (OTR) density in specific brain regions. We found that OTR density in the nucleus accumbens (NA) is highest in juvenile prairie voles, intermediate in juvenile rats, and lowest in juvenile mice and meadow voles. In the caudate putamen (CP), OTR binding was highest in prairie voles, intermediate in rats and meadow voles, and lowest in mice. In contrast, the lateral septum (LS) shows an opposite pattern, with OTR binding being high in mice and meadow voles and low in prairie voles and rats. Thus, alloparental responsiveness in juvenile rodents is positively correlated with OTR density in the NA and CP and negatively correlated with OTR density in the LS. We then investigated whether a similar receptor-behavior relationship exists among juvenile female prairie voles by correlating individual variation in alloparental behavior with variation in OTR density. The time spent adopting crouching postures, the most distinctive component of alloparental behavior in juveniles, was positively correlated with OTR density in the NA (r = 0.47) and CP (r = 0.45) and negatively correlated with OTR density in the lateral septum (r = -0.53). Thus, variation in OTR density in the NA, CP, and LS may underlie both species and individual differences in alloparental care in rodents. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The study was conducted by direct observation of 29 adult African giant pouched rats' brains. In the telencephalon, the cerebral cortex was devoid of prominent gyri and sulci, but the large olfactory bulb and tract relaying impulses to the olfactory cortex were very prominent. The large size of the olfactory bulb correlated with the established sharp olfactory acuity of the rodent. In the mesencephalic tectum, the caudal colliculi were bigger than the rostral colliculi, indicating a more acute sense of hearing than sight. In the metencephalon, the cerebellar vermis, the flocculus and the paraflocculus were highly coiled and, thus, well developed. The myelencephalon revealed a better organised ventral surface than dorsal surface; the cuneate fascicle, the intermediate sulcus and the lateral sulcus were not evident on the dorsal surface, but there were clearly visible pyramids and olivary prominence on the ventral surface. In conclusion, the highly coiled cerebellar vermis, flocculus and paraflocculus, as well as the conspicuous pyramids and olivary prominence are indicative of a good motor coordination and balance in the African giant pouched rat.},

abstract = {In a two-choice odor preference test, male Norway rats (Long-Evans) with monogamous mating experience reliably prefer the odor from a novel female over the odor from the female with which each male earlier gained all of its mating experience. Previous research indicated that females with monogamous mating experience exhibit a preference in the opposite direction; i.e., they prefer the odor from a male with which they gained all their mating experience over the odor from a novel male. These olfactory preferences are mediated by endogenous chemical signals that enable rats to recognize one another as individuals. Moreover, the responses of male and female Norway rats to the odors from familiar vs novel sex partners are consistent with current views concerning the masculine and feminine mating strategies characteristic of this species, especially in the matter of mate selection. {\textcopyright} 1980, Academic Press, Inc..

abstract = {Significant advances have been made in understanding kin recognition as it pertains to nepotism (preferential treatment of kin) and mate choice (optimization of inbreeding and outbreeding). Yet complementary knowledge about how animals discriminate conspecifics on the basis of genetic relatedness remains unclear for most species. Because of the diversity of their scent sources and highly developed olfactory systems, rodents present a unique opportunity for examining chemical communication and kin recognition as a function of sociality. I review general processes of kin recognition and summarize mechanisms of recognition used by rodents. As a case study, I also examine recognition systems of ground squirrels, relating odor production and perception to differences in patterns of nepotism. Belding's ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi) produce {\^{a}}‰¥2 odors (from oral and dorsal glands) that correlate with relatedness (kin labels), and they are able to use these odors to make precise discriminations among their unfamiliar relatives. Thus, S. beldingi can recognize their distant female kin and male kin, even though these kin are not treated nepotistically (e.g., through cooperative territory defense or alarm call production). Furthermore, S. beldingi use these kin labels and recognition abilities to interact differentially with conspecifics as a function of relatedness. In ground squirrels and in other rodents, components of the kin recognition process (production of recognition cues, discrimination of these cues, and differential treatment of conspecifics) have evolved differentially among even closely related species. Kin recognition abilities in the absence of nepotism might reflect selection for inbreeding avoidance mechanisms, in addition to sex-biased natal dispersal. Together, data and the review demonstrate that recognition abilities cannot be predicted on the basis of sociality alone and suggest that comparative analyses, by multiple assays of discrimination, might be necessary to understand variation in the function of kin recognition within and across species.},

abstract = {In mammals, odor detection in the nose is mediated by a diverse family of olfactory receptors (ORs), which are used combinatorially to detect different odorants and encode their identities. The OR family can be divided into subfamilies whose members are highly related and are likely to recognize structurally related odorants. To gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying odor detection, we analyzed the mouse OR gene family. Exhaustive searches of a mouse genome database identified 913 intact OR genes and 296 OR pseudogenes. These genes were localized to 51 different loci on 17 chromosomes. Sequence comparisons showed that the mouse OR family contains 241 subfamilies. Subfamily sizes vary extensively, suggesting that some classes of odorants may be more easily detected or discriminated than others. Determination of subfamilies that contain ORs with identified ligands allowed tentative functional predictions for 19 subfamilies. Analysis of the chromosomal locations of members of each subfamily showed that many OR gene loci encode only one or a few subfamilies. Furthermore, most subfamilies are encoded by a single locus, suggesting that different loci may encode receptors for different types of odorant structural features. Comparison of human and mouse OR subfamilies showed that the two species have many, but not all, subfamilies in common. However, mouse subfamilies are usually larger than their human counterparts. This finding suggests that humans and mice recognize many of the same odorant structural motifs, but mice may be superior in odor sensitivity and discrimination.},

abstract = {In the mammalian peripartum period, the activity of both the brain oxytocin and vasopressin system is elevated as part of the physiological adaptations occurring in the mother. This is reflected by increased expression and intracerebral release of oxytocin and vasopressin, as well as increased neuropeptide receptor expression and binding. In this review we discuss the functional role of the brain oxytocin and vasopressin system in the context of maternal behavior, specifically maternal care and maternal aggression in rodents. In order to enable the identification of significant and peptide-specific contributions to the display of maternal behavior, various complementary animal models of maternal care and/or maternal aggression were studied, including rats selectively bred for differences in anxiety-related behavior (HAB and LAB dams), monitoring of local neuropeptide release during ongoing maternal behavior, and local pharmacological or genetic manipulations of the neuropeptide systems. The medial preoptic area was identified as a major site for oxytocin- and vasopressin-mediated maternal care. Furthermore, both oxytocin and vasopressin release and receptor activation in the central amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis play an important role for maternal aggression.

abstract = {Chemosensory cues stimulate male sexual arousal and behavior. The main olfactory system has an important role in attracting males to estrous females, and the vomeronasal receptors are important for activating accessory olfactory pathways that engage mating behavior in a sexually dimorphic manner. The gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons like the vomeronasal organ (VNO) neurons take their origin in the olfactory placode and migrate to the basal forebrain along pathfinder axons that take their origin in the developing VNO. The maturation of both systems is synchronized in time such that the early postnatal testosterone surge masculinizes the VNO neural relay en route to the medio preoptic area (MPOA). Although VNO slices and VNO receptor neurons in culture respond to volatile odors, in vivo electrophysiological recordings at the first relay in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) are silent until the male makes active nuzzling investigations of the female. The VNO neurons may therefore respond to volatiles that are transported into the organ on carrier peptides that themselves may play a part in receptor activation. In the context of modern molecular phylogenetic studies, it is becoming less likely that pheromones acting via the VNO have any part to play in human sexual behavior, but the possibility exists for conserved VNO genes influencing human reproduction via fertilization. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Here we used a combination of calcium imaging and single-cell RT–PCR to identify odorant receptors (ORs) for odorants with related structures but varied odors. We found that one OR recognizes multiple odorants and that one odorant is recognized by multiple ORs, but that different odorants are recognized by different combinations of ORs. Thus, the olfactory system uses a combinatorial receptor coding scheme to encode odor identities. Our studies also indicate that slight alterations in an odorant, or a change in its concentration, can change its “code,” potentially explaining how such changes can alter perceived odor quality.},

abstract = {The neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin and their receptors have been implicated in elements of mammalian social behavior such as attachment to mates and offspring, but their potential role in mediating other types of social relationships remains largely unknown. We performed receptor autoradiography to assess whether forebrain oxytocin receptor (OTR) or vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) distributions differed with social structure in two closely related and ecologically similar species of South American rodents, the colonial tuco-tuco (Ctenomys sociabilis) and the Patagonian tuco-tuco (Ctenomys haigi). Long-term field studies have revealed that C. haigi is solitary, whereas C. sociabilis is social and provides a model of female-based group living. Our analyses revealed marked differences in OTR and V1aR distributions between these species. For example, only C. sociabilis had OTR binding in the piriform cortex and thalamus and V1aR binding in the olfactory bulbs. In contrast, C. haigi exhibited dramatically higher levels of OTR binding throughout the lateral septum and hippocampus. More generally, the group-living C. sociabilis exhibited a pattern of nucleus accumbens OTR and ventral pallidum V1aR binding different from that associated with the formation of opposite-sex pair bonds in microtine rodents. Higher binding in the central nucleus of the amygdala of C. sociabilis was consistent with the hypothesis that formation of social groups in C. sociabilis may be facilitated by reduced social anxiety. Low OTR binding in the lateral septum might also be a permissive factor for group living in C. sociabilis. Future studies will expand on these analyses to explore interspecific differences in ctenomyid receptor binding patterns in a phylogenetic context.},

In nearly every vertebrate species examined thus far arginine vasopressin (AVP) and its homologues modulate behavior; thus, providing rich systems for comparative research. In rodents, AVP is best known for its modulation of social behavior; however, to date, research on AVPs effects on behavior have been limited to laboratory models and a few experiments using large outdoor enclosures. To extend our understanding of AVPs role in modulating social behavior and communication in an ecologically relevant context, we examined the effects of AVP on behavior of free-living Richardson's ground squirrels (Urocitellus richardsonii). To test the hypothesis that AVP influences social behavior and communication, we implanted osmotic minipumps into Richardson's ground squirrels and centrally administered AVP or saline as a control. Three different behavioral experiments quantifying behavior before and after AVP or saline administration were performed: a general behavior survey, a predator model presentation, and a social challenge test. AVP administration increased male vocalization rate when approached by a conspecific, but not when presented with a predator model. In males, social aggression decreased, but antipredator vigilance increased with AVP administration. Finally, AVP-treated females had increased "anxiety-like" behaviors during the social challenge test. Our data reveal that AVP has sex-specific effects on vocalizations and antipredator vigilance, as well as other social behaviors. Further, our data illustrate the importance of social context to AVPs modulation of behavior.},

abstract = {In seasonally breeding male oscines, song learning and expression are controlled by brain regions (vocal control regions, VCRs) that exhibit seasonal neural plasticity in adulthood. Several VCRs contain androgen receptors, and gonadal androgens play important roles in the control of seasonal structural and functional changes of VCRs. Recent studies also found that adult VCRs are influenced by factors other than gonadal hormones, including photoperiod, but the relative importance of these factors and their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. To address this issue, we investigated the contributions of photoperiod and testicular androgens to the regulation of VCR volumes and to the control of song expression in adult dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis. Exposing castrated (CX) photosensitive males to long days (LD) enhanced their high vocal center (HVc) volumes compared to those of males held on short days (SD). These volumes were not further increased by concurrent testosterone (T) treatment, revealing a marked and gonadal androgen-independent stimulatory influence of photoperiod on the size of this brain region. HVc sizes were smaller in LD-exposed photorefractory than photosensitive males irrespective of whether birds were intact or had been castrated before photoperiodic manipulations, but HVc sizes increased in response to T treatment in intact photorefractory males. Thus, LD exposure can increase HVc volumes in the absence of gonadal T, but large volume induction in photorefractory males requires elevated plasma T levels. Testosterone treatment of SD-exposed photosensitive males increased HVc, but not Area X, MAN, or RA volumes. Only T-treated males sang and this treatment given to castrates was equally effective behaviorally when administered to photosensitive, photostimulated, or photorefractory juncos. This result indicates that the stimulating influence of LD exposure on HVc volumes is insufficient to induce song in the absence of elevated plasma T levels.},

abstract = {In the mammalian forebrain, most neurons originatefrom proliferating cells in the ventricular zone liningthe lateral ventricles, including a discrete area of thesubventricular zone in which neurogenesis continuesinto adulthood. The majority of the cells generated inthe anterior portion of the subventricular zone (SVZa)are neuronal precursors with progeny that migrate tothe olfactory bulb (OB) along a pathway known as therostral migratory stream (RMS). The list of factors thatinﬂuence the proliferation and survival of neurons inthe adult brain remains incomplete, but previous studies have implicated neurotrophins in mammals andestrogen in birds. This study examined the effect ofestrus induction on the proliferation of SVZa neuronsin female prairie voles. Prairie voles, unlike many otherrodents, are induced into estrus by chemosensorycues from a male. This olfactory-mediated processresults in an increase in serum estrogen levels and theconsequent induction of behavioral estrus (sexual receptivity). Female prairie voles induced into estrus bymale exposure had a 92{\%} increase in BrdU-labeledcells in the SVZa compared to females exposed to afemale. Double-label immunocytochemical studiesdemonstrated that 80{\%} of the BrdU-labeled cells inthe RMS displayed a neuronal phenotype. Ovariectomized females exposed to a male did not show anincrease in serum estrogen or BrdU labeling in theRMS. Conversely, ovariectomized females injectedwith estrogen were sexually receptive and had moreBrdU-labeled cells in the RMS than oil-injected females. These data suggest that, in female prairievoles, estrus induction is associated with increasednumbers of dividing cells in the RMS, possibly via anestrogen-mediated process.},

abstract = {The choice of an appropriate sample size for a study is a notoriously neglected topic in behavioural research, even though it is of utmost importance and the rules of action are more than clear – or are they? They may be clear if a formal power analysis is concerned. However, with the educated guesswork usually applied in behavioural studies there are various trade-offs, and the degrees of freedom are extensive. An analysis of 119 original studies haphazardly chosen from five leading behavioural journals suggests that the selected sample size reflects an influence of constraints more often than a rational optimization process. As predicted, field work involves greater samples than studies conducted in captivity, and invertebrates are used in greater numbers than verte- brates when the approach is similar. However, it seems to be less impor- tant for determining the number of subjects if the study employs observational or experimental means. This is surprising because in con- trast to mere observations, experiments allow to reduce random varia- tion in the data, which is an essential precondition for economizing on sample size. By pointing to inconsistent patterns the intention of this article is to induce thought and discussion among behavioural research- ers on this crucial issue, where apparently neither standard procedures are applied nor conventions have yet been established. This is an issue of concern for authors, referees and editors alike.},

It is fundamental therefore to understand any such effects for effective risk assessment. This study investigated the impact of a transient exposure to ethinylestradiol (EE2) during early life (from 20−60 days post fertilization), including at a dosing level within the environmental range, on the subsequent reproductive behavior and success in both male and female zebrafish (Danio rerio) in competitive breeding scenarios. There were no obvious effects of the early life EE2 exposures on the subsequent gonadal phenotypes in either mature males or females. In fact, reproductive success in males exposed to 2.76 ng EE2/L was increased in competitive spawning scenarios. In contrast, exposure of females to EE2 (9.86 ...},

abstract = {Scent marking is often assumed to be a secondary sexual trait that increases males' mating and reproductive success, although direct evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. We conducted a study with wild-derived house mice, Mus musculus musculus, to test whether scent marking increases males' reproductive success when females can freely choose between two territorial males. We also experimentally manipulated males' competitive scent marking by exchanging scent-marked tiles between the neighbouring males' territories (intrusion treatment) or relocating males' tiles within their own territory (control). Experimental animals were tested twice and we examined whether individual males were consistent in their marking. We found that males marked more in the intrusion treatment than controls and more at shared territorial borders than elsewhere. We found high day-to-day variation in most individuals' scent marking, and yet the sum of individuals' scent marking was consistent over time and across different social conditions. Genetic paternity analyses revealed that males' scent marking significantly increased their reproductive success in both the intrusion treatment and the controls. Surprisingly, however, female social preference was not positively correlated with male scent marking. These results provide direct evidence that scent marking increases males' reproductive success when females can choose their mates, even though it did not increase females' social preferences. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Rats perceived binary mixtures composed of similar components as different from their 2 components, whereas binary mixtures composed of dissimilar components were perceived as very similar to their components.

abstract = {The most significant social behaviour of the lactating mother is maternal behaviour, which comprises maternal care and maternal aggression (MA). The latter is a protective behaviour of the mother serving to defend the offspring against a potentially dangerous intruder. The extent to which the mother shows aggressive behaviour depends on extrinsic and intrinsic factors, as we have learned from studies in laboratory rodents. Among the extrinsic factors are the pups' presence and age, as well as the intruders' sex and age. With respect to intrinsic factors, the mothers' innate anxiety and the prosocial brain neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) play important roles. While OXT is well known as a maternal neuropeptide, AVP has only recently been described in this context. The increased activities of these neuropeptides in lactation are the result of remarkable brain adaptations peripartum and are a prerequisite for the mother to become maternal. Consequently, OXT and AVP are significantly involved in mediating the fine-tuned regulation of MA depending on the brain regions. Importantly, both neuropeptides are also modulators of anxiety, which determines the extent of MA. This review provides a detailed overview of the role of OXT and AVP in MA and the link to anxiety.},

The neuroanatomical distribution of vasopressin V1a receptors varies greatly between species with different forms of social organization. Here we show that centrally administered arginine vasopressin increases affiliative behaviour in the highly social, monogamous prairie vole, but not in the relatively asocial, promiscuous montane vole. Molecular analyses indicate that gene duplication and/or changes in promoter structure of the prairie vole receptor gene may contribute to the species differences in vasopressin-receptor expression. We further show that mice that are transgenic for the prairie vole receptor gene have a neuroanatomical pattern of receptor binding that is similar to that of the prairie vole, and exhibit increased affiliative behaviour after injection with arginine vasopressin. These data indicate that the pattern of V1a-receptor gene expression in the brain may be functionally associated with species-typical social behaviours in male vertebrates.},

abstract = {Primates are notable for having a rich and detailed understanding of their social environment and there has been great interest in the evolution and function of social knowledge in primates. Indeed, primates have been shown to have impressive understandings of not only other group members but also the complex relationships among them. To be useful, however, social knowledge requires memories from previous encounters and observations about individual traits that are stable. Here, we argue that social systems or traits that make social knowledge more costly or less accurate will favor signals that either supplement or replace social knowledge. Thus, the relationship between signals and social knowledge can be complementary or antagonistic depending on the type of signal. Our goal in this review is to elucidate the relationships between signals and social knowledge in primates. We categorize signals into three types, each with different relationships to social knowledge. (1) Identity signals directly facilitate social knowledge, (2) current-state signals supplement information gained through social knowledge, and (3) badges of status replace social knowledge. Primates rely extensively on identity information, but it remains to be determined to what extent this is based on receiver perception of individual variation or senders using identity signals. Primates frequently utilize current-state signals including signals of intent to augment their interactions with familiar individuals. Badges of status are rare in primates, and the cases where they are used point to a functional and evolutionary trade-off between badges of status and social knowledge. However, the nature of this relationship needs further exploration.},

abstract = {Pair-bonding has been suggested to be a critical factor in the evolutionary development of the social brain. The brain neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) exerts an important influence on pair-bonding behavior in voles. There is a strong association between a polymorphic repeat sequence in the 5' flanking region of the gene (avpr1a) encoding one of the AVP receptor subtypes (V1aR), and proneness for monogamous behavior in males of this species. It is not yet known whether similar mechanisms are important also for human pair-bonding. Here, we report an association between one of the human AVPR1A repeat polymorphisms (RS3) and traits reflecting pair-bonding behavior in men, including partner bonding, perceived marital problems, and marital status, and show that the RS3 genotype of the males also affects marital quality as perceived by their spouses. These results suggest an association between a single gene and pair-bonding behavior in humans, and indicate that the well characterized influence of AVP on pair-bonding in voles may be of relevance also for humans.},

abstract = {The ability to discriminate among individuals plays a fundamental role in the establishment of social relationships in animals. We examined how Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) discriminate among individuals using odor. In the first experiment, the ability of male gerbils to discriminate among five odor sources from different individuals was investigated using a habituation-dishabituation paradigm. After male gerbils had been habituated to a scent from one individual, they were exposed to familiar and unfamiliar scents from different donors simultaneously. Where urine and ventral gland secretions were used, the subjects spent more time investigating novel odors than familiar ones, suggesting that they were able to discriminate individual differences in these odor sources. However, with the scents of feces and saliva, they could detect, but could not discriminate individual differences; with scent from inside the pinnae, they could not even detect. In the second experiment, we tested whether cross-habituation occurred between the scents of urine and ventral gland secretions. A male was exposed repeatedly to urine from one of two familiar donor males during four habituation trials, and was then exposed to the ventral gland secretions from two donors simultaneously. The subject males spent more time investigating scents of ventral gland secretions, but there was no difference in the investigation time between ventral gland scents from the two donors. These results suggest that male gerbils discriminate among individuals using odors from urine and ventral gland secretions and that cross-habituation may not occur between these scents during social-memory formation. ? 2007 Zoological Society of Japan.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anogenital distance (AGD) is sexually dimorphic in rodents and humans, being 2- to 2.5-fold greater in males. It is a reliable marker of androgen and antiandrogen effects in rodent reproductive toxicologic studies. Data on AGD in humans are sparse, with no longitudinal data collected during infancy. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine AGD from birth to 2 years in males and females and relate this to other anthropometric measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Infants were recruited from the Cambridge Baby Growth Study. AGD was measured from the center of the anus to the base of the scrotum in males and to the posterior fourchette in females. Measurements were performed at birth and at 3, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. RESULTS: Data included 2,168 longitudinal AGD measurements from 463 male and 426 female full-term infants (median = 2 measurements per infant). Mean AGD (+/- SD) at birth was 19.8 +/- 6.1 mm in males and 9.1 +/- 2.8 mm in females (p {\textless} 0.0001). AGD increased up to 12 months in both sexes and in a sex-dimorphic pattern. AGD was positively correlated with penile length at birth (r = 0.18, p = 0.003) and the increase in AGD from birth to 3 months was correlated with penile growth (r = 0.20, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: We report novel, longitudinal data for AGD during infancy in a large U.K. birth cohort. AGD was sex dimorphic at all ages studied. The availability of normative data provides a means of utilizing this biological marker of androgen action in population studies of the effects of environmental chemicals on genital development.},

abstract = {Behavioural reciprocity can be evolutionarily stable1−3. Initial increase in frequency depends, however, on reciprocal altruists interacting predominantly with other reciprocal altruists either by associating within kin groups or by having sufficient memory to recognize and not aid nonreciprocators. Theory thus suggests that reciprocity should evolve more easily among animals which live in kin groups. Data are available separating reciprocity from nepotism only for unrelated nonhuman animals4. Here, I show that food sharing by regurgitation of blood among wild vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) depends equally and independently on degree of relatedness and an index of opportunity for recipro cation. That reciprocity operates within groups containing both kin and nonkin is supported further with data on the availability of blood-sharing occasions, estimates of the economics of shar ing blood, and experiments which show that unrelated bats will reciprocally exchange blood in captivity.},

Both female and male juveniles are attracted to familiar odors while adults show preferences for odors of opposite-sex conspecifics. Females show an increased preference for male odors as they mature, but no study has examined whether change with age is seen in males. In this experiment, responses of weanling and mature male and female pine voles (Microtus pinetorum) to familiar odor cues from their family versus those of an unfamiliar, opposite-sex conspecific were examined. Voles were tested in a three-chambered cage with end chambers containing the stimuli. There was a significant difference in odor preference between weanling and mature females. Weanling females preferred odor cues from their families, and mature females preferred the odors of unfamiliar mature males. The pattern was similar in males but the effect was not as strong. The results support the hypothesis that responses to odor cues change with age in pine voles. At least for females, the change in response to odor cues may be involved in the timing of reproduction and thus dispersal.},

abstract = {The present study examined the hypothesis that oxytocin (OT) may influence female sexual behavior in prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). The effectiveness of OT to induce sexual behavior was tested in ovariectomized females that were injected daily with estradiol benzoate (EB, 0.02 $\mu$g, twice), a dose insufficient for estrus induction. On the third day females received intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of OT (1, 300, or 1000 ng) or saline vehicle. In the presence of minimal estrogen stimulation, OT did not induce sexual receptivity, or influence autogrooming or other social interactions. The behavioral effects of OT were examined in another group of ovariectomized females that received daily oil or EB injections (10 $\mu$g, twice) followed on the third day by either ICV (1, 300, or 1000 ng) or intraperitoneal (IP) (1, 3, or 10 $\mu$g) injections of OT. Among EB-treated females, only those in confirmed estrus, prior to ICV or IP injection, were included in these studies. There was a dose-related decrease in the percentage of females that remained in behavioral estrus after ICV OT. In those females that continued to show sexual behavior, lordosis frequencies and durations were unaffected by ICV OT. Nonsexual behavior did not differ between mated females and those exhibiting OT-inhibited sexual behavior. In females that were EB-treated, autogrooming and side-by-side behavior increased after ICV OT, while there was a decline in aggression. Female sexual and nonsexual behaviors were not significantly affected by IP OT. However, males paired with IP-OT females showed reductions in anogenital investigation and aggression toward IP-OT injected females; male autogrooming increased if females were EB-treated and received IP OT. OT did not induce sexual behavior or affect other social behaviors or autogrooming in oil-treated female prairie voles. These results suggest that centrally active OT may inhibit sexual receptivity and promote social behavior and autogrooming in female prairie voles, while peripheral OT may alter the stimulus properties of the female.},

abstract = {Chemical communication plays many key roles in mammalian reproduction, although attention has focused particularly on male scent signalling. Here, we review evidence that female chemical signals also play important roles in sexual attraction, in mediating reproductive competition and cooperation between females, and in maternal care, all central to female reproductive success. Female odours function not only to advertise sexual receptivity and location, they can also have important physiological priming effects on male development and sperm production. However, the extent to which female scents are used to assess the quality of females as potential mates has received little attention. Female investment in scent signalling is strongly influenced by the social structure and breeding system of the species. Although investment is typically male-biased, high competition between females can lead to a reversed pattern of female- biased investment. As among males, scent marking and counter-marking are often used to advertise territory defence and high social rank. Female odours have been implicated in the reproductive suppression of young or subordinate females across a range of social systems, with females of lower competitive ability potentially benefiting by delaying reproduction until conditions are more favourable. Further, the ability to recognise individuals, group members and kin through scent underpins group cohesion and cooperation in many social species, as well as playing an important role in mother-offspring recognition. However, despite the diversity of female scent signals, chemical communication in female mammals remains relatively understudied and poorly understood. We highlight several key areas of future research that are worthy of further investigation.},

abstract = {This review focuses on the importance of cortisol in mediating the inhibitory effects of psychosocial stress on reproduction in females. In particular, we have summarized our research in sheep where we have systematically established whether cortisol is both sufficient and necessary to suppress reproductive hormone secretion and inhibit sexual behaviour. Our findings are put into context with previous work and are used to develop important concepts as well as to identify productive further lines of investigation. It is clear that cortisol is necessary to inhibit some, but not all, aspects of reproduction in female sheep. These actions vary with reproductive state, and there are important interactions with gonadal steroids. The impact of cortisol on the tonic secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone has been investigated extensively, but less is known about the surge secretion of these hormones and their effects on sexual behaviour. Furthermore, there are separate effects of cortisol in the brain (hypothalamus) and at the anterior pituitary, illustrating that there are different mechanisms of action. Thus, although cortisol is important in mediating some of the effects of stress on reproduction, we need to look beyond cortisol and investigate some of the other mechanisms and mediators that relay the effects of stress on reproduction. In this regard, we propose that a group of neurons in the hypothalamus that co-synthesize kisspeptin, neurokinin B and dynorphin, termed KNDy cells, play important roles in mediating the effects of cortisol on reproduction. This hypothesis needs to be rigorously tested.},

This study examined the distribution of fibers, terminals, and somata immunoreactive for two neuropeptides, methionine-enkephalin (ENK) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), in song-control nuclei of adult males. In addition, the broad pattern of major regions of labeling throughout the forebrain and midbrain was determined. The telencephalic song-control nuclei MAN (magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum), Area X of the striatum, HVC (higher vocal center), and RA (robust nucleus of the archistriatum) contained abundant ENK immunoreactivity, including labeled fibers and somata. In addition, intensely labeled fibers and terminals were seen in the thalamic nucleus DLM (medial portion of the dorsolateral nucleus of the anterior thalamus). High levels of VIP immunoreactivity were also seen in MAN, HVC, and RA, but this label consisted of fiber and terminals only. Area X and surrounding striatum contained extremely sparsely distributed VIP-labeled processes. Somata positive for VIP were not seen throughout cortical regions such as the neostriatum and hyperstriatum but were abundant in the lateral striatum (paleostriatum augmentatum, PA) and may contribute to a dense field of terminal labeling seen in the globus pallidus. The apparent presence of a robust VIP-positive striato-pallidal projection is not typical of major basal ganglia pathways in vertebrates, raising the possibility that passerine birds have diverged from the typical amniote pattern.},

More recent studies have revealed a more general role for oxytocin in modulating affiliative behavior in both sexes. Oxytocin regulates alloparental care and pair bonding in female monogamous prairie voles. Social recognition in male and female mice is also modulated by oxytocin. In humans, oxytocin increases gaze to the eye region of human faces and enhances interpersonal trust and the ability to infer the emotions of others from facial cues. While the neurohypopheseal oxytocin system has been well characterized, less is known regarding the nature of oxytocin release within the brain. Here we review the role of oxytocin in the regulation prosocial interactions, and discuss the neuroanatomy of the central oxytocin system.},

abstract = {Although prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are socially monogamous, males vary in both sexual and spatial fidelity. Most males form pairbonds, cohabit with one female, and defend territories. Wandering males, in contrast, have expansive home ranges that overlap many males and females. In the laboratory, pairing is regulated by arginine vasopressin and its predominant CNS receptor, vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR). We investigated individual differences in forebrain V1aR expression of male prairie voles in mixed-sex seminatural enclosures. Individual differences in V1aR were compared with space use measured by radio telemetry and paternity determined with microsatellite markers. Animals engaging in extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs) as either wanderers or paired residents overlapped significantly more in same- and opposite-sex home ranges. Surprisingly, neither social fidelity measured by space use nor sexual fidelity measured by paternity was associated with V1aR expression in the ventral pallidum (VPall) or lateral septum, areas causally related to pairbond formation. In contrast, V1aR expression in the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex (PCing) and laterodorsal thalamus (LDThal), areas implicated in spatial memory, strongly covaried with space use and paternity. Animals engaging in EPFs either as wanderers or paired residents exhibited low levels of LDThal and PCing V1aR expression. Individual differences in brain and behavior parallel differences between prairie voles and promiscuous congeners. The concordance among space use, paternity, and V1aR in spatial circuits suggests a common link between the mechanisms of spatial behaviors and success at EPF. The combined data demonstrate how organismal biology can inform our understanding of individual and species differences in behavioral mechanisms.},

abstract = {Abstract Food availability affects whether mammals communicate their interest in interacting with opposite-sex conspecifics. This study examined the responses of voles to over-marks, and factors that influence the formation and maintenance of a preference for the top-scent in an over-mark. Specifically, we investigated how food deprivation affected the amount of time male and female voles exposed to an over-mark, later responded to the marks of the top- and bottom-scent donors when subsequently presented with the two scents side by side. Males and females that were not food deprived and males that were food deprived 6 h before exposure to an over-mark later maintained a preference for the donor of the top-scent mark compared with the donor of the bottom-scent mark of the over-mark. Females that were food deprived for 6 h before or after exposure of the over-mark and males food deprived 6 h after the exposure to the over-mark showed no preference for the top-scent mark donor. Re-feeding females that were food deprived for 6 h before exposure to an over-mark was sufficient to restore their preference for the mark of the top-scent male over that of the bottom-scent male. The different responses of food-deprived male and female voles to over-marks of opposite-sex conspecifics may be associated with differences in their tactics for interacting with potential mates and the higher energetic costs of reproduction in female voles than in male voles.},

abstract = {De novo assembly of RNA-seq data enables researchers to study transcriptomes without the need for a genome sequence; this approach can be usefully applied, for instance, in research on 'non-model organisms' of ecological and evolutionary importance, cancer samples or the microbiome. In this protocol we describe the use of the Trinity platform for de novo transcriptome assembly from RNA-seq data in non-model organisms. We also present Trinity-supported companion utilities for downstream applications, including RSEM for transcript abundance estimation, R/Bioconductor packages for identifying differentially expressed transcripts across samples and approaches to identify protein-coding genes. In the procedure, we provide a workflow for genome-independent transcriptome analysis leveraging the Trinity platform. The software, documentation and demonstrations are freely available from http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net. The run time of this protocol is highly dependent on the size and complexity of data to be analyzed. The example data set analyzed in the procedure detailed herein can be processed in less than 5 h.},

abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.Results: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.

abstract = {The removal of the posterior and intermediate lobe of the pituitary (posterior lobectomy) in rats, facilitates the rate of extinction of a conditioned avoidance response without affecting avoidance learning. The abnormal extinction behaviour of posterior lobectomized rats appeared not to be due to the disturbance in water metabolism resulting from the removal of the posterior pituitary. Pitressin, purified lysine vasopressin, synthetic $\alpha$-MSH and ACTH (A1 peptide) admini-stered as long acting preparations during the period of extinction, inhibited the rapid rate of extinction (of the avoidance response) in posterior lobectomized rats.

The amniotic fluid of the female fetuses contains higher concentrations of estradiol than that of male fetuses. Male fetuses that developed in utero between female fetuses had higher concentrations of estradiol in their amniotic fluid than males that were located between other male fetuses during intrauterine development. They were also more sexually active as adults, less aggressive, and had smaller seminal vesicles than males that had developed between other male fetuses in utero. These findings raise the possibility that during fetal life circulating estrogens may interact with circulating androgens both in regulating the development of sex differences between males and females and in producing variation in phenotype among males and among females.},

abstract = {Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are synthetic chemicals that arise from sources such as pesticides and have the ability to mimic or inhibit gonadal steroid hormones. The objective of this research was to examine the effects of EDCs on the behaviors associated with monogamy and the expression of related neuropeptide receptors. Pine voles, a novel experimental mammal, were chosen because they display strong monogamous pair bonding. Female pine voles were orally administered estrogenic diethylstilbestrol (DES) and methoxychlor (MXC) or oil control throughout gestation and lactation of pups. Exposed pups were tested as adults. Preference for the mate and maternal behaviors were assessed. While the ability to form partner preferences was intact, DES-exposed females showed increased aggression toward a stranger, while MXC exposed females showed a strong trend toward spending more time alone. Oxytocin (OT) receptor binding in the brain was assessed for possible effects on this behaviorally important neuropeptide signaling system. The cingulate cortex showed a reduction in OT binding in the MXC group. These findings demonstrate that exposure to EDCs during pre- and neonatal development can alter female adult neural phenotype and behavior related to monogamous behavior traits. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Many nonmodel species exemplify important biological questions but lack the sequence resources required to study the genes and genomic regions underlying traits of interest. Reef-building corals are famously sensitive to rising seawater temperatures, motivating ongoing research into their stress responses and long-term prospects in a changing climate. A comprehensive understanding of these processes will require extending beyond the sequenced coral genome (Acropora digitifera) to encompass diverse coral species and related anthozoans. Toward that end, we have assembled and annotated reference transcriptomes to develop catalogs of gene sequences for three scleractinian corals (Fungia scutaria, Montastraea cavernosa, Seriatopora hystrix) and a temperate anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima). High-throughput sequencing of cDNA libraries produced {\~{}}20-30 million reads per sample, and de novo assembly of these reads produced {\~{}}75,000-110,000 transcripts from each sample with size distributions (mean {\~{}}1.4 kb, N50 {\~{}}2 kb), comparable to the distribution of gene models from the coral genome (mean {\~{}}1.7 kb, N50 {\~{}}2.2 kb). Each assembly includes matches for more than half the gene models from A. digitifera (54-67{\%}) and many reasonably complete transcripts ({\~{}}5300-6700) spanning nearly the entire gene (ortholog hit ratios ≥0.75). The catalogs of gene sequences developed in this study made it possible to identify hundreds to thousands of orthologs across diverse scleractinian species and related taxa. We used these sequences for phylogenetic inference, recovering known relationships and demonstrating superior performance over phylogenetic trees constructed using single mitochondrial loci. The resources developed in this study provide gene sequences and genetic markers for several anthozoan species. To enhance the utility of these resources for the research community, we developed searchable databases enabling researchers to rapidly recover sequences for genes of interest. Our analysis of de novo assembly quality highlights metrics that we expect will be useful for evaluating the relative quality of other de novo transcriptome assemblies. The identification of orthologous sequences and phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrates the feasibility of these methods for clarifying the substantial uncertainties in the existing scleractinian phylogeny.},

Escape reactions and agonistic behaviour were completely lost as from the second generation. Wild rats were easily tamed and those born in captivity were very social. However, being a burrowing rodent, preferring a cool environment in nature, they had a low tolerance to heat. Cannibalism was an important management problem which persisted to the fourth generation resulting in the mortality of 40{\%} of the newly born. From the fifth generation onwards, rats became completely tame and docile. Cannibalism was reduced to less than 10{\%} of the newly born at the fifteenth generation.

abstract = {During long "summer-like" photoperiods, female Syrian hamsters display a regular 4-day estrous cycle. However, during short "winter-like" photoperiods ({\textless}12.5 h of light/day) hamsters become anestrus. Short photoperiod exposure eliminates reproductive behavior but social behaviors such as aggression and scent marking continue to be displayed. In long photoperiods, the types and intensity of social behaviors change as a function of the estrous cycle. For example, aggression and scent marking tend to occur at higher levels on diestrus 1 and diestrus 2 than on proestrus or estrus. Aggression and scent marking may be regulated, at least in part, by changes in the density of arginine vasopressin-V1areceptors (V1aR). In Experiment 1, it was hypothesized that the density of V1aR would change across the estrous cycle in several subcortical regions implicated in the regulation of aggression and scent marking. In Experiment 2, it was hypothesized that exposure to short photoperiod would alter the density of V1aR in several regions involved in the regulation of social behavior. Interestingly, there were no dramatic changes in V1aR binding across the estrous cycle within any of the neuroanatomical areas measured. However, in hamsters housed in short photoperiod, there were lower levels of V1aR binding within the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), medial preoptic area (MPO), lateral hypothalamus (LH), central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) than in hamsters housed in long photoperiod. These data suggest that photoperiodic mechanisms can alter the density of V1aR in subset of V1abinding sites thought to be involved in the regulation of social behaviors in female hamsters. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Testosterone affects the allocation of reproductive effort in male birds. Elevated testosterone causes male dark-eyed juncos,Junco hyemalis, to decrease care of dependant offspring, but this generalization is based largely on reduced provisioning rates by males treated with testosterone. Therefore, we used a predator model to explore the relationship between testosterone and nest defence, a more immediate measure of male parental effort. Control males (C-males) were more likely to respond within 10min to a mount of an eastern chipmunk,Tamias striatus, placed at the nest than were testosterone-treated males (T-males). However, among males that did respond within 10min, T-males initiated nest defence as fast as C-males and defended the nest with equal intensity. Females initiated nest defence more rapidly and struck the mount more often than their mates, regardless of the male's treatment. Overall, the decreased likelihood of T-males being present for nest defence (perhaps mediated by their large home ranges) may increase predation rates at their nests and represent an important cost of elevated testosterone levels.},

abstract = {Behaviors associated with monogamy, including pair-bond formation, are facilitated by the neuropeptide vasopressin and are prevented by a vasopressin receptor [V1a receptor (V1aR)] antagonist in the male prairie vole. The neuroanatomical distribution of V1aR dramatically differs between monogamous and nonmonogamous species. V1aR binding is denser in the ventral pallidal region of several unrelated monogamous species compared with nonmonogamous species. Because the ventral pallidum is involved in reinforcement and addiction, we hypothesize that V1aR activation in this region promotes pair-bond formation via a mechanism similar to conditioning. Using an adeno-associated viral vector to deliver the V1aR gene, we increased the density of V1aR binding in the ventral pallial region of male prairie voles. These males exhibited increased levels of both anxiety and affiliative behavior compared with control males. In addition, males overexpressing the V1aR in the ventral pallidal region, but not control males, formed strong partner preferences after an overnight cohabitation, without mating, with a female. These data demonstrate a role for ventral pallidal V1aR in affiliation and social attachment and provide a potential molecular mechanism for species differences in social organization.},

abstract = {Comparisons between monogamous and promiscuous vole species have proven useful in examining neurobiological mechanisms underlying social attachment. Reward processing is important for social attachment, and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) exerts a direct influence on reward pathways. Dopamine (DA), oxytocin (OT), and arginine vasopressin (AVP) all have been implicated in the regulation of social attachment in monogamous voles. Therefore, we used radiolabeled ligands to examine dopamine D1- and D2-like, OT, and AVP V1a receptor binding densities in the mPFC of monogamous and promiscuous voles. Species differences were found; monogamous voles had higher densities of D2-like and OT receptor binding and lower densities of D1-like and V1a receptor binding than did promiscuous voles. Sex differences also were found; females had higher densities of OT receptor binding but lower densities of V1a receptor binding than did males in both species. Further, the laminar distribution of receptor binding indicates the possibility of an interaction between DA and OT systems in the mPFC in the regulation of social attachment. Differences in D1- and D2-like receptor binding between species are discussed in terms of how they might modulate cortical activity and subsequent DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc).},

Adult males and adult females sniffed scented cubes longer than unscented cubes, sniffed cubes with scent from other (strange and neighbouring) males longer than cubes with the resident male's own scent, and sniffed cubes with scent from strange males longer than cubes with scent from neighbouring males. Males also scent-marked the cubes on a number of occasions; differences in the frequency with which the cubes were marked followed the same pattern. It thus appears that adult Columbian ground squirrels can recognize familiar as opposed to unfamiliar males, and may also be able to determine individual identity, through oral gland scent. An ability to distinguish familiar from unfamiliar males by scent could be advantageous in facilitating differential treatment of wandering strange males versus established neighbours. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {Intranasal application of zinc gluconate has commonly been used to treat the common cold. The safety of this treatment, however, has come into question recently. In addition to a United States recall of a homeopathic product that contains zinc gluconate, abundant literature reports cytotoxic effects of zinc on the olfactory epithelium. Additional research suggests that divalent cations (such as zinc) can block ion channels that facilitate the transduction of odors into electrical signals on the olfactory epithelium. The purpose of the current study was 2-fold: to confirm whether zinc gluconate causes anosmia and to reveal whether any other divalent cationic compounds produce a similar effect. Groups of mice underwent a buried food-pellet test to gauge olfactory function and then were nasally irrigated with 1 of 3 divalent cationic compounds. When tested after treatment, mice irrigated with zinc gluconate and copper gluconate experienced a marked increase in food-finding time, indicating that they had lost their ability to smell a hidden food source. Control mice irrigated with saline had a significantly lower increase in times. These results confirm that zinc gluconate can cause anosmia and reveal that multiple divalent cations can negatively affect olfaction.

abstract = {Proteins and peptides are used as pheromones by many invertebrates and vertebrates, on land as well as underwater. These molecules are used as pheromones by aquatic animals such as squid, sea hares, and newts. Males in some terrestrial salamander species use high molecular weight glycopeptide pheromones transferred directly to the nostrils of the female. In Drosophila fruit flies, sex peptides in the male's seminal fluid change the female's behaviour so that after mating she rejects other males and starts to lay eggs. The rapid evolution of Drosophila sex peptides and salamander peptide pheromones suggests that sexual conflict may be involved. In mice, exocrine gland-secreting peptide 1 (ESP1) secreted from the male's tear glands is transferred to the female's nose through physical contact during investigation of the facial areas during courtship. ESP1 activates a narrowly specific vomeronasal receptor, leading to receptive behaviour in the female. The urine marks of male territorial house mice contain high concentrations of highly variable major urinary proteins (MUPs). The MUPs bind small molecule pheromones and other odorants, slowly releasing them and thus greatly prolonging the attractive volatile lifetime of the signal. One of the MUPs, darcin, is the same in all male house mice: it is a pheromone in itself. When the female comes into contact with darcin in a scent mark it prompts a learned attraction to both the male's individual chemical signature mixture and the location of the scent mark. Proteins and peptides may also contribute to the highly variable chemical profiles that differ between individual mammals, for example, and that are used as cues to allow individuals to be distinguished.},

Mothers were observed during a free-play session with each of their 3.5-year-old twins. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that mothers who are carriers of the AVPR1A RS3 allele tend to show less structuring and support throughout the interaction independent of the child's sex and RS3 genotype. This finding advances our understanding of the genetic influences on human maternal behaviour.},

abstract = {According to the kin selection theory the degree of genetic relatedness affects the nature of intraspecific competition and it might promote cooperative and/or altruistic behavior between individuals. We examined kinship effects on reproductive success of territorial females and survival of juveniles in the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus. Four experimental populations were founded in large enclosures (0.5 ha): two consistent of five related (Related, R) and two of five mutually unrelated females (Unrelated, UR). Each population had five males of heterogeneous origin. Our earlier results showed that populations of the R grew twice as fast as the UR. Here we show that recruitment and offspring survival is connected to spacing behavior of mothers. Unrelated females who had their home range close to each other produced significantly fewer recruits that the related ones. There home ranges overlapped significantly less and ranges were smaller if they were situated close to each other. Furthermore, the survival of juveniles declined with dispersal distance from the natal territory in populations of the UR. Trappabilities of juveniles were also lower among the young whose home range were close to unrelated females, indicating avoidance of mature females. Our results indicate that competition for space is more intense among related neighbors, decreasing their reproductive success. Infanticide towards unrelated nestlings and/or juveniles is one possible mechanism decreasing survival and causing a lower recruitment of young. On the contrary, sharing of space among related neighbors did not seem to cause notable costs on their reproduction. Mature females allowed related young females to use their territory, but still, the young did not acquire an area for their own reproduction, probably due to a mother-daughter conflict. The basic social structure of Clethrionomys populations, i.e., exclusive female territoriality, remain the same regardless of a high degree of relatedness.},

abstract = {Social play activities among juveniles are thought to contribute to the development of social and emotional skills in humans and animals. Conversely, social play deficits are observed in developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Importantly, many of these disorders show sex differences in incidence, course of the disease, and severity of symptoms. We hypothesized that sex differences in the neural systems controlling social behavior can contribute to these differences. We therefore studied the involvement of the sexually dimorphic vasopressin and oxytocin systems, which have been implicated in these disorders, in juvenile social play behavior. Single-housed 5-week-old juvenile male and female rats were exposed in their home cage to an age-and sex-matched novel conspecific for 10 min, and social play behaviors were recorded. We found no consistent sex differences in duration or elements of social play in vehicle-treated rats. However, intracerebroventricular injection of the specific vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) antagonist (CH2)5Tyr(Me(2))AVP significantly reduced social play behaviors in males while increasing them in females. Intracerebroventricular injection of the specific oxytocin receptor antagonist des-Gly-NH2,d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)(2),Thr(4)]OVT did not alter social play in either sex. To locate the effects of V1aR blockade on social play, we targeted the lateral septum, a sexually dimorphic brain region showing denser vasopressin fibers in males than in females and an abundant expression of V1aR in both sexes. Surprisingly, blockade of V1aR in the lateral septum increased social play behaviors in males, but decreased them in females. These findings suggest sex- and brain region-specific roles for vasopressin in the regulation of social play behavior in juvenile rats.},

We examined the effects of removing the male on pregnancy success in prairie voles and meadow voles, two species that differ in degree of paternal investment. Whereas prairie vole males provide extensive care to offspring and accelerate pup development, meadow vole males display little or no care and delay development of pups. We predicted that removal of the stud male would decrease pregnancy success in prairie voles and either have no effect or increase success in meadow voles. In experiment 1, females were in male-induced estrus, and their mates were either left with them or were removed 4 h, 1 day, 2 days, or 8 days after mating. In experiment 2, females were in postpartum estrus, and their mates were either left with them or were removed 1 day, 2 days, or 8 days after birth of their first litter. Removal of the male soon after mating in postpartum estrus decreased pregnancy success in prairie voles and increased success in meadow voles. Thus, although removal of the stud male influenced litter production, the direction of the effect varied with species.},

The Japanese animals more proficiently discriminated the peak feature when stimuli were presented to the right ear (primarily left cerebral hemisphere), as opposed to the left ear (primarily right hemisphere). In discriminating the pitch feature, the Japanese animals either showed (i) a left-ear processing advantage or (ii) no ear advantage. The comparison animals, with one exception, showed no ear advantage in processing either feature of the vocalizations.

Therefore, their molecular identity, native sources, and the meaning of their detection has been largely speculative. There has been recent success in identifying a variety of candidate mouse pheromones and other specialized odors. These discoveries reveal that mammalian pheromones come in a variety of ligand types and they are detected by sensory neurons that are pre-set to promote an array of social and survival behaviors. Importantly, recent findings show that they activate molecularly diverse sensory neurons that differ from canonical odorant detectors. These novel sensory neurons hold future promise to unlock the mystery of how their detection is hardwired to generate behavior.},

Here we show that detection and processing of fear-evoking odors emitted from cat, rat, and snake require the function of sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ. To investigate the molecular nature of the sensory cues emitted by predators, we isolated the salient ligands from two species using a combination of innate behavioral assays in naive receiving animals, calcium imaging, and c-Fos induction. Surprisingly, the defensive behavior-promoting activity released by other animals is encoded by species-specific ligands belonging to the major urinary protein (Mup) family, homologs of aggression-promoting mouse pheromones. We show that recombinant Mup proteins are sufficient to activate sensory neurons and initiate defensive behavior similarly to native odors. This co-option of existing sensory mechanisms provides a molecular solution to the difficult problem of evolving a variety of species-specific molecular detectors. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Experiments were conducted to determine if the chronic absence of the neurotransmitter oxytocin (OT) in null mice resulted in alterations in the responsiveness and abundance of central OT receptors. Self-grooming elicited by intracerebroventricularly administered OT was studied as an indicator of the activation of central OT receptors and autoradiography was used to map the distribution and density of OT receptors in OT null and wild type mice. The intracerebroventricular administration of OT, but not vehicle, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), produced a robust increase in grooming behavior in both OT null and wild type animals, P{\textless}.001. However, OT-induced grooming was significantly greater in OT null than wild type mice, P{\textless}.005. The enhanced grooming was selective to OT as indicated by the finding that grooming to intracerebroventricular arginine vasopressin (AVP) was of the same magnitude in both OT null and wild type mice. OT-induced grooming appears to be mediated through the activation of OT receptors because pretreatment of animals with an OT antagonist, Atosiban, abolished OT-induced grooming, but not AVP-induced grooming. OT receptor distribution and binding in brains of OT null and wild type mice were examined by autoradiography and were not significantly different. The results indicate that the chronic absence of OT in null mice leads to an increase in OT receptor responsiveness that contributes to the augmented grooming activity elicited by centrally administered OT.},

abstract = {If parasitic infection is a driving force in female mate choice, then females should preferentially select parasite-free males. The role of infection on female mate choice in mammals was assessed using a 3-chambered apparatus. A female CD-1 mouse was allowed to choose between 2 tethered male mice, 1 uninfected and 1 infected with 200 larvae (L3) of the intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Both uninfected and infected males were equally receptive to the oestrous females, and females did not differ in the number of visits and time spent exploring the 2 males. Female time preference was not a useful predictor of ultimate mate choice, whereas first mount preference of the female was a reliable indicator. Results indicate that female mice preferentially mated with uninfected males as evidenced by first ejaculation choice, but that male infection status did not significantly affect female reproductive success. Interestingly, litters sired by infected males contained a significantly higher percentage of females suggesting that parasite-induced hormonal changes may alter the sex ratio of the offspring. This study provides the first direct evidence of the impact of parasitic infection on mammalian mate choice.},

abstract = {Oxytocin (OT) is a deeply conserved nonapeptide that acts both peripherally and centrally to modulate reproductive physiology and sociosexual behavior across divergent taxa, including humans. In vertebrates, the distribution of the oxytocin receptor (OTR) in the brain is variable within and across species, and OTR signaling is critical for a variety of species-typical social and reproductive behaviors, including affiliative and pair bonding behaviors in multiple socially monogamous lineages of fishes, birds, and mammals. Early work in prairie voles suggested that the endogenous OT system modulates mating-induced partner preference formation in females but not males; however, there is significant evidence that central OTRs may modulate pair bonding behavior in both sexes. In addition, it remains unclear how transient windows of central OTR signaling during sociosexual interaction modulate neural activity to produce enduring shifts in sociobehavioral phenotypes, including the formation of selective social bonds. Here we re-examine the role of the central OT system in partner preference formation in male prairie voles using a selective OTR antagonist delivered intracranially. We then use the same antagonist to examine how central OTRs modulate behavior and immediate early gene (Fos) expression, a metric of neuronal activation, in males during brief sociosexual interaction with a female. Our results suggest that, as in females, OTR signaling is critical for partner preference formation in males and enhances correlated activation across sensory and reward processing brain areas during sociosexual interaction. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that central OTR signaling facilitates social bond formation by coordinating activity across a pair bonding neural network.},

abstract = {The expression of oxytocin receptor (OT-R) mRNA in the rat central nervous system was examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry using cRNA probe. Wide distribution of cells expressing OT-R mRNA was observed not only in the hypothalamus, but also in other regions. There were high levels of OT-R mRNA in the anterior olfactory nuclei, tenia tecta, olfactory tubercle, rostral most region of the frontal cortex, piriform cortex, layers 2 and 3 of the neocortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior medial preoptic nucleus (AV3V region), magnocellular preoptic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, retrochiasmatic nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, central amygdaloid nucleus, medial amygdaloid nucleus, posterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus, amygdalohippocampal area, subiculum, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus. In most regions of the brain, our findings concurred with those obtained by receptor binding autoradiography using a ligand specific to OT. However, in the inferior olive nucleus, OT-R mRNA was not detected despite an abundance of binding sites showed by receptor binding autography. Despite this discrepancy OT appears to have central nervous system functions in addition to its hormonal functions.},

abstract = {Many types of social attachments can be observed in nature. We discuss the neurobiology of two types (1) intraspecific (with a partner) and (2) parental (with the offspring). Stimuli related to copulation facilitate the first, whereas pregnancy, parturition and lactation facilitate the second. Both types develop as consequence of cohabitation. These events seem to stimulate similar neural pathways that increase (1) social recognition, (2) motivation, reward; and (3) decrease fear/anxiety. Subregions of the amygdala and cortex facilitate social recognition and also disinhibition to decrease rejection responses. The interrelationship between MeA, BNST, LS may mediate the activation of NAcc via the mPOA to increase motivation and reward. Cortical areas such as the ACC discriminate between stimuli. The interaction between OT and D2-type receptors in NAcc shell facilitates intraspecific attachment, but D1-type appears to facilitate parental attachment. This difference may be important for maternal females to direct their attention, motivation and expression of attachment toward the appropriate target. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Previous studies have revealed that the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin (OT) has developmental effects on subsequent social behavior and on mechanisms underlying social behavior such as OT neurons and estrogen receptor $\alpha$. This suggests that OT might also have developmental effects on neural responses to social stimuli. This was tested in socially monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) by manipulating OT on the first day of life and then assessing the response to a heterosexual pairing in adulthood. The response to cohabitation was assessed by quantifying neural activation in regions of the brain associated with sociosexual behavior and anxiety using c-Fos immunoreactivity. Additionally, immunocytochemistry was used to label OT and vasopressin neurons and plasma was assayed for both neuropeptides. Treatment effects were evident in females, but not in males. Blockade of OT receptors with an OT antagonist on the first day of life resulted in neural activation of the central amygdala in response to a pairing with a novel male in adulthood. The central amygdala does not normally express c-Fos after a heterosexual pairing in reproductively na{\"{i}}ve prairie voles.

abstract = {Accurately encoding time is one of the fundamental challenges faced by the nervous system in mediating behavior. We recently reported that some animals have a specialized population of rhythmically active neurons in their olfactory organs with the potential to peripherally encode temporal information about odor encounters. If these neurons do indeed encode the timing of odor arrivals, it should be possible to demonstrate that this capacity has some functional significance. Here we show how this sensory input can profoundly influence an animal's ability to locate the source of odor cues in realistic turbulent environments-a common task faced by species that rely on olfactory cues for navigation. Using detailed data from a turbulent plume created in the laboratory, we reconstruct the spatiotemporal behavior of a real odor field. We use recurrence theory to show that information about position relative to the source of the odor plume is embedded in the timing between odor pulses. Then, using a parameterized computational model, we show how an animal can use populations of rhythmically active neurons to capture and encode this temporal information in real time, and use it to efficiently navigate to an odor source. Our results demonstrate that the capacity to accurately encode temporal information about sensory cues may be crucial for efficient olfactory navigation. More generally, our results suggest a mechanism for extracting and encoding temporal information from the sensory environment that could have broad utility for neural information processing.},

abstract = {The distribution of vasopressin receptors was studied in the brain of a photoperiodic animal, the Siberian hamster. Attention was focused on [3Hvasopressin bnding sites located in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus, medial tuberal nucleus, and ventral premmmilary nucleus in males or females kept in long or short photoperiod conditions. Displacement experiments with struural analg s that vasopressin receptors in the ham hypothalamus are ofthe vasopressor (VI) type. Quantitative data obtained with a gaseous detector of-part indicated that in the ventromedial nucleus and in the ventral premammillar nucleus of animals in long photoperiod, the number of 13-particles emitted per unit area was s y greater in males than in females. In the ventromedial hypotha-lamic nucleus, in both males and females, the number of 13-par-ies emitted was sig tly ower in short than in long pho-toperiodconditions. In the ventral prenammillary nucleus, shortening of the photoperiod had a s ant effect in reducing the amount of [3Hjvasopressin bound in females, but not in males. These data suggest that, in the hamster, the control of the expression of vasopressin receptors differs among various hypo-tlm nuclei and may depend on the sex and/or on the level of circulating gonadal steroids. In photoperiodic species, the activity of the gonads is modulated by the length of the daily light phase and by its chronicity over weeks. Thus, in spring and summertime-during the long photoperiod (LP)-the Siberian hamster is sexually active, whereas in the short photoperiod (SP)-autumn and winter-its gonads atrophy, and the animals become sexually inactive. At the end of winter, the process is reversed and the gonads increase again in weight (1-3). Circulating gonadal steroids follow a parallel course: their level is lowered following shortening of the photoperiod, and this effect is reversed when the photoperiod increases again (4-8). These physiological modifications may be artificially induced in controlling the length of the photoperiod in animal husbandry (9). In the Siberian hamster, gonadal regression is directly under photoperiodic control: it is not dependent on the temperature or the amount offood available (1, 2, 10, 11). In both male and female rats, oxytocin-binding sites in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus are down-regulated by castration, and they can be restored to precastration level by injections of sexual steroids (12-16). We investigated the distribution of vasopressin-and oxytocin-binding sites in the brain of male and female Siberian hamsters either in LP or SP conditions, using a newly developed gaseous detector of 13-particles (17) and film autoradiography. We discovered that in Siberian hamsters, vasopressin receptors rather than ox-ytocin receptors are present in the ventromedial hypotha-lamic nucleus and that they are expressed differentially in the male and in the female. Furthermore, the density of the binding was found to be dependent on photoperiod. MATERIAL AND METHODS Animals. Young adult Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sun-gorus) were maintained under either a LP (16/8-hr light/dark cycle) or a SP (8/16-hr light/dark cycle) for 10 weeks. Temperature was set at 20 ±+ 1C and humidity at 60-70o. The animals received tap water and food pellets ad libitum. Fourteen males (9 in LP, 5 in SP) and 11 females (7 in LP, 4 in SP) were used for the autoradiographic localization of vasopressin-and oxytocin-binding sites in the brain. Animals , 5 months old with a body weight of 30-50 g, were decapitated, and the testes were removed and weighed, or the uterus was inspected, to assess the activity of the gonads (2, 18). The brain was frozen in isopentane at-250C, and 15-I.m-thick coronal sections were cut in a cryostat, laid on gelatin/chromalum-coated slides, air-dried, and processed for light microscopic autoradiography. Autoradiography. Autoradiography of vasopressin-binding sites was performed as described (19) with 1.5 nM [3H]va-sopressin as the ligand. Hydroxy[Thr4,Gly7]oxytocin, a selective oxytocin agonist (20), was added to the incubation medium to reduce binding of [3H]vasopressin to oxytocin receptors. To assess the amount of nonspecific labeling, adjacent sections were treated in the same conditions, except that the incubation medium contained in addition 10 AM nonradioactive vasopressin. To determine whether the va-sopressin-binding sites were of the V1-or V2-type, competition experiments were performed on sections containing the ventral hypothalamus. The incubation medium was then supplemented with 150 nM [Phe2,Orn8]vasotocin, a VI (va-sopressor type) receptor agonist in which Om = ornithine, or 1-deamino-[D-Arg8]vasopressin (dDAVP), a peptide selective for V2 (antidiuretic type) receptors (20). Oxytocin-binding sites were detected by using as ligand 0.05 nM 125I-labeled 8-ornithine/9-tyrosinamide-containing vasotocin (125I-OTAVT) designated 1-deamino-[Cys(CH2)A, Tyr(Me)2, Thr4, Orn8, Tyr9-NH2]vasotocin in-which Cys-1 has been deaminated and substituted on the side chain with cyclopentamethylene to form [1-(3-mercapto-34,-cyclopen-tamethylenepropionic acid), 2-O-methyltyrosine, 4-threo-nine, 8-ornithine, 9-tyrosinamide]vasotocin.

abstract = {In addition to various reproductive stimuli, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is released both from the neurohypophysial terminal into the blood stream and within distinct brain regions in response to stressful or social stimuli. Brain OXT receptor-mediated actions were shown to be significantly involved in the regulation of a variety of behaviours. Here, complementary methodological approaches are discussed which were utilised to reveal, for example, anxiolytic and anti-stress effects of OXT, both in females and in males, effects that were localised within the central amygdala and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Also, in male rats, activation of the brain OXT system is essential for the regulation of sexual behaviour, and increased OXT system activity during mating is directly linked to an attenuated anxiety-related behaviour. Moreover, in late pregnancy and during lactation, central OXT is involved in the establishment and fine-tuned maintenance of maternal care and maternal aggression. In monogamous prairie voles, brain OXT is important for mating-induced pair bonding, especially in females. Another example of behavioural actions of intracerebral OXT is the promotion of social memory processes and recognition of con-specifics, as revealed in rats, mice, sheep and voles. Experimental evidence suggests that, in humans, brain OXT exerts similar behavioural effects. Thus, the brain OXT system seems to be a potential target for the development of therapeutics to treat anxiety- and depression-related diseases or abnormal social behaviours including autism.},

abstract = {Previous comparative studies have suggested that the distribution of arginine vasopressin (AVP) pathways within the brain is associated with species-typical patterns of social behavior. In the current study, male parental behavior and aggression were compared in two species of Peromyscus. As predicted based on other studies, male mice from a monogamous species, the California mouse Peromyscus californicus, spent more time providing parental care to offspring than males from a polygamous species, the white-footed mouse Peromyscus leucopus. Sexually naive male California mice also attacked opponents more rapidly than white-footed mice during resident–intruder and neutral aggression tests. Since AVP has been shown to modulate these behaviors, we compared the distribution of vasopressinergic neurons and receptors. We predicted that greater AVP-immunoreactive (AVP-ir) staining in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and AVP receptor density in the lateral septum would occur in the species with low levels of paternal care because this pattern was found in similar comparisons with sexually naive monogamous and polygamous voles. In contrast, in our study, monogamous male mice showed more AVP-ir staining in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis than the polygamous species, as well as more AVP receptors in the lateral septum. Parental behavior therefore does not appear to predict differences in patterns of AVP-ir staining and receptor distribution across species or vice versa. We propose the hypothesis that aggression may be better correlated with species patterns of AVP-ir staining density and receptor distribution.},

abstract = {Scent over-marking is a common form of competitive advertisement among many species of mammals. Recent observations in golden hamsters, Mesocricetus auratushave suggested that individuals have specialized mechanisms for interpretation of and response to such over-marks. In this study, we examined whether meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicushave similar abilities. Female voles were first exposed to anogenital scent marks of two males and were then tested in a Y-maze for their preferences for whole-body odours of these two males. Experiments were run using a variety of configurations of scent marks during the exposure phase, but all experiments yielded consistent results. If the scent marks of the two males overlapped, females later preferred the whole-body odours of the male whose scent was on top; if the two scent marks did not overlap, females showed no preference. Females also preferred odours of familiar males over novel males, and preferred both top-scent and bottom-scent males over novel males. The results suggest that female voles can tell which individual's scent is on top in an over-mark and that they prefer this top-scent male, even though they know that both males' scents were present during the exposure phase. We suggest that these odour preferences reflect mate preferences and discuss possible reasons why females might prefer top-scent males.1997The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract = {Hamsters preferentially remember or value the top scent of a scent over-mark. What cues do they use to do this? Using habituation-discrimination techniques, we exposed male golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) on 3 to 4 trials to genital over-marks from 2 females and then tested subjects for their familiarity with these 2 scents compared with that of a novel female's secretion. Preferential memory for 1 of the 2 individuals' scents did not occur if the 2 marks did not overlap or did not overlap but differed in age, but it did occur if a region of overlap existed or 1 mark apparently occluded another (but did not overlap it). Thus, hamsters use regions of overlap and the spatial configuration of scents to evaluate over-marks. These phenomena constitute evidence for previously unsuspected perceptual abilities, including olfactory scene analysis, which is analogous to visual and auditory scene analysis.},

abstract = {Although the biological roots of aggression have been the source of intense debate, the precise physiological mechanisms responsible for aggression remain poorly understood. In most species, aggression is more common in males than females; thus, gonadal hormones have been a focal point for research in this field. Although gonadal hormones have been shown to influence the expression of aggression, in many cases aggression can continue after castration, indicating that testicular steroids are not completely essential for the expression of aggression. Recently, the mammalian neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been implicated in aggression. AVP plays a particularly important role in social behavior in monogamous mammals, such as prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). In turn, the effects of social experiences may be mediated by neuropeptides, including AVP. For example, sexually naive prairie voles are rarely aggressive. However, 24 h after the onset of mating, males of this species become significantly aggressive toward strangers. Likewise, in adult male prairie voles, central (intracerebroventricular) injections of AVP can significantly increase intermale aggression, suggesting a role for AVP in the expression of postcopulatory aggression in adult male prairie voles. In this paper, we demonstrate that early postnatal exposure to AVP can have long-lasting effects on the tendency to show aggression, producing levels of aggression in sexually naive, adult male prairie voles that are comparable to those levels observed after mating. Females showed less aggression and were less responsive to exogenous AVP, but the capacity of an AVP V1a receptor antagonist to block female aggression also implicates AVP in the development of female aggression.},

abstract = {1. The presence of siblings might have long-lasting fitness consequences because they influence the early environment in which an animal develops. Several studies under laboratory conditions have shown long-lasting consequences from the presence of male siblings in utero on morphology and life-history traits. However, in wild animals, such effects of litter sex composition are unexplored. 2. We capitalized on a long-term study of individually marked yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) and documented the effects of weaned litter sex composition and anogenital distance on several life-history and fitness traits. 3. First, we demonstrated that the number of males in a litter influenced anogenital distance. Then, we found that masculinized females, those with larger anogenital distances, were less likely to survive their first hibernation, were more likely to disperse and were less likely to become pregnant and wean young. Males from male-biased litters had lower growth rates, but we failed to detect longer-term consequences. 4. Taken together, our results show profound sex-dependent effects of litter sex composition, probably due to differential prenatal exposure to androgens, in free-living animals. We conclude that masculinization might constitute an alternative mechanism explaining variation in different demographic traits. This finding highlights the importance of studying these maternal effects, and they enhance our concern over the widespread use of endocrine disrupting compounds.},

abstract = {Differences among conspecifics in body mass result from underlying differences in structural size and physiological condition. To determine whether the structural or physiological component of body mass has a stronger influence on reproductive traits at parturition, we studied the body composition (lean dry mass and fat content), structural size (1st principal component scores computed from 10 skeletal measurements), and body condition (residuals from regression of body mass on structural size) of yearling and older female Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii). At parturition, differences among yearlings in body mass primarily reflected differences in structural size associated with continuing structural growth. Older females appeared to reach a deterministic adult structural size, and body mass of older females was most strongly associated with body condition. Structural size of yearling females and body condition of older females had significant positive effects on litter mass. For older females, date of parturition had a significant negative influence on litter size. Both yearling and older females exhibited significant positive effects of parturition date and body condition on neonate mass. In older females, a trade-off resulted in smaller litters of heavier neonates as the breeding season progressed, perhaps reflecting the need for rapid growth of offspring before hibernation. Maternal size, maternal condition, and seasonal timing were important aspects of reproduction in Richardson's ground squirrels, but these characteristics are seldom considered concurrently in studies of life histories.},

abstract = {The superior colliculus (SC) is responsible for sensorimotor transformations required to direct gaze toward or away from unexpected, biologically salient events. Significant changes in the external world are signaled to SC through primary multisensory afferents, spatially organized according to a retinotopic topography. For animals, where an unexpected event could indicate the presence of either predator or prey, early decisions to approach or avoid are particularly important. Rodents' ecology dictates predators are most often detected initially as movements in upper visual field (mapped in medial SC), while appetitive stimuli are normally found in lower visual field (mapped in lateral SC). Our purpose was to exploit this functional segregation to reveal neural sites that can bias or modulate initial approach or avoidance responses. Small injections of Fluoro-Gold were made into medial or lateral sub-regions of intermediate and deep layers of SC (SCm/SCl). A remarkable segregation of input to these two functionally defined areas was found. (i) There were structures that projected only to SCm (e.g., specific cortical areas, lateral geniculate and suprageniculate thalamic nuclei, ventromedial and premammillary hypothalamic nuclei, and several brainstem areas) or SCl (e.g., primary somatosensory cortex representing upper body parts and vibrissae and parvicellular reticular nucleus in the brainstem). (ii) Other structures projected to both SCm and SCl but from topographically segregated populations of neurons (e.g., zona incerta and substantia nigra pars reticulata). (iii) There were a few brainstem areas in which retrogradely labeled neurons were spatially overlapping (e.g., pedunculopontine nucleus and locus coeruleus). These results indicate significantly more structures across the rat neuraxis are in a position to modulate defense responses evoked from SCm, and that neural mechanisms modulating SC-mediated defense or appetitive behavior are almost entirely segregated.},

abstract = {We investigated in an aviary experiment the behavioral and hormonal responses of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) that were moved from a same sex group to an aviary containing either a nest box alone, a nest box and another male, or a nest box and a female. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (T) levels increased significantly and independently of the situation, suggesting that nest boxes were the most important stimulus affecting the levels of these hormones. Some birds occupied more than two boxes (winners), and others a single or no box (losers). Levels of T increased less in males that did not acquire a nest box. However, the increase in LH was similar in all males after the test. Singing was positively correlated with T levels. Winners started singing earlier and sang more during a contest than losers. In the presence of females LH increased more in winners than in losers, while the increase in T was similar in both groups. In females, there was no increase in T but LH increased in the presence of males. Levels were higher in females paired with winners than in females paired with losers. Finally, winners advertised their nest boxes more frequently than losers. These results indicate that within a relatively short time frame levels of LH and T increase following the transfer from a flock to a territorial situation and can react independently from each other depending on reproductive circumstances. For males, the possession of a nest box and, for females, the qualities of the male seemed to be the most important factors stimulating reproduction.},

abstract = {Recent evidence shows that, despite earlier beliefs, many birds have a functional sense ofsmell. There is also considerable variation in olfactory-bulb size among bird species, yet the evolutionary significance of this variation has remained elusive. We argue that birds living under low-light conditions, where vision is less efficient, should have evolved or maintained an increased olfactory ability and, hence, larger olfactory bulbs. Using a family-level comparative analysis to control at least partially for taxonomic artifacts, we show that none ofa series ofecological variables (diet, nest type, development, nest dispersion, and migratory behavior) accounts for variation in olfactory-bulb size once the effects ofbody size and brain size (measured by cerebral-hemisphere length) have been controlled. Activity timing, however, accounts for significant variation even after the removal ofthese other variables. We discovered 13 independent cases in which nocturnal or crepuscular lineages have evolved a diurnal habit, or vice versa, and compared relative olfactory- bulb sizes between each branch pair. In all but one case, nocturnal or crepuscular birds have larger olfactory bulbs than their diurnal counterparts. We therefore demonstrate a widespread relationship between ecology and the evolutionary development of a part ofthe brain},

Here, we investigate the effects of the mother's presence in a population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) on the Isle of Rum, Scotland, which is the subject of a long-term, individual-based study. We compared measures of performance including antler growth in young males and age at first reproduction in females and survival of deer with mothers still alive against those that have lost their mothers (orphans). We show that orphaning both before and after weaning increases the risk of a natural death for both sexes. For males, no maternal benefit was detectable past 24 months of age while, for females, post-weaning benefits continued throughout life. Orphaning resulted in compromised male physical condition as measured by a reduced probability of growing antlers by 16 months of age while no evidence for compromised reproduction was found in females. These results support assertions that post-weaning maternal associations affect the development and survival of offspring. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We exposed female prairie voles and meadow voles to two treatments: a mother and one 23-26-day-old daughter paired with a strange male and a 23-26-day-old daughter paired with a different strange male. We found no differences in the proportion of daughters breeding or the time to sexual maturation for daughters raised in the two treatments for either species. Thus, we have no indication that mothers had any adverse effect on reproductive efforts of their daughters. These results differ from previous studies that concluded young female prairie voles were reproductively suppressed by female relatives. The difference between our and previous studies on reproductive suppression is that we examined breeding in young females rather than proximate measures of growth and reproductive development. We question the evolutionary significance of reproductive suppression among related female microtine rodents, especially in that it has not been documented from field populations. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Humans and song-learning birds communicate acoustically using learned vocalizations. The characteristic features of this social communication behavior include vocal control by forebrain motor areas, a direct cortical projection to brainstem vocal motor neurons, and dependence on auditory feedback to develop and maintain learned vocalizations. These features have so far not been found in closely related primate and avian species that do not learn vocalizations. Male mice produce courtship ultrasonic vocalizations with acoustic features similar to songs of song-learning birds. However, it is assumed that mice lack a forebrain system for vocal modification and that their ultrasonic vocalizations are innate. Here we investigated the mouse song system and discovered that it includes a motor cortex region active during singing, that projects directly to brainstem vocal motor neurons and is necessary for keeping song more stereotyped and on pitch. We also discovered that male mice depend on auditory feedback to maintain some ultrasonic song features, and that sub-strains with differences in their songs can match each other's pitch when cross-housed under competitive social conditions. We conclude that male mice have some limited vocal modification abilities with at least some neuroanatomical features thought to be unique to humans and song-learning birds. To explain our findings, we propose a continuum hypothesis of vocal learning.},

In men, AVP stimulates agonistic facial motor patterns in response to the faces of unfamiliar men and decreases perceptions of the friendliness of those faces. In contrast, in women, AVP stimulates affiliative facial motor patterns in response to the faces of unfamiliar women and increases perceptions of the friendliness of those faces. AVP also affected autonomic responsiveness to threatening faces and increased anxiety, which may underlie both communication patterns by promoting different social strategies in stressful contexts in men and women.},

abstract = {Background: The chemosensory system plays an important role in orchestrating sexual behaviors in mammals. Pheromones trigger sexually dimorphic behaviors and different mouse strains exhibit differential responses to pheromone stimuli. It has been speculated that differential gene expression in the sensory organs that detect pheromones may underlie sexually-dimorphic and strain-specific responses to pheromone cues. Results: We have performed transcriptome analyses of the mouse vomeronasal organ, a sensory organ recognizing pheromones and interspecies cues. We find little evidence of sexual dimorphism in gene expression except for Xist, an essential gene for X-linked gene inactivation. Variations in gene expression are found mainly among strains, with genes from immune response and chemosensory receptor classes dominating the list. Differentially expressed genes are concentrated in genomic hotspots enriched in these families of genes. Some chemosensory receptors show exclusive patterns of expression in different strains. We find high levels of single nucleotide polymorphism in chemosensory receptor pseudogenes, some of which lead to functionalized receptors. Moreover, we identify a number of differentially expressed long noncoding RNA species showing strong correlation or anti-correlation with chemoreceptor genes. Conclusions: Our analyses provide little evidence supporting sexually dimorphic gene expression in the vomeronasal organ that may underlie dimorphic pheromone responses. In contrast, we find pronounced variations in the expression of immune response related genes, vomeronasal and G-protein coupled receptor genes among different mouse strains. These findings raised the possibility that diverse strains of mouse perceive pheromone cues differently and behavioral difference among strains in response to pheromone may first arise from differential detection of pheromones. On the other hand, sexually dimorphic responses to pheromones more likely originate from dimorphic neural circuits in the brain than from differential detection. Moreover, noncoding RNA may offer a potential regulatory mechanism controlling the differential expression patterns.},

abstract = {SETTING: Resource-limited settings in sub-Saharan African countries. OBJECTIVE: To utilise African giant pouched rats (Cricetomys gambianus) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in human sputum. DESIGN: A specially designed cage with 10 sniffing holes and cassette-carrier was used. The sputum samples were put in the sample cassette, containing 10 samples in line, placed under matching sniffing holes. Rats were trained to sniff each consecutive sample, and indicate TB positives by fixing their nose for 5 seconds at the sniffing hole. This behaviour was maintained by food reinforcement upon correct indications. A total of 3416 samples were used. RESULTS: Of the 20 trained rats, 18 were able to discriminate positive from negative sputum samples, with average daily sensitivities ranging from 72{\%} to 100{\%}, and average daily false-positives ranging from 0.7{\%} to 8.1{\%}. The use of multiple rats significantly increased sensitivity and negative predictive value. CONCLUSION: Utilising trained sniffer rats for TB detection is a potentially faster screening method and is at least as sensitive as smear microscopy. This method could therefore be suitable for active case finding, especially where large numbers of samples are to be analysed in resource-limited settings, to complement existing diagnostic techniques.},

abstract = {A series of experiments were conducted with wild house mice to verify the effect of intrauterine position on females' anogenital distance at birth (AGD) and to examine the relationships between a female's AGD, used as a bioassay of androgen exposure during fetal life, and her social behavior and reproductive success in adulthood. Experiment 1 showed that cesarean-delivered females that developed in utero between two males (2 M females) have significantly longer AGD's than females positioned between two females (0 M females). We then categorized naturally delivered females shortly after birth as having a long, medium or short AGD. In adulthood, these females were tested for their behavior towards unfamiliar pups, their rate of urine-marking in response to a variety of social stimuli, postpartum aggression and success in protecting their litters in response to male and female intruders. Adult females with different AGD's at birth did not differ either in their behavior toward pups or in their rate of urine marking. Conversely, males housed across a wire mesh partition from a long-AGD female deposited a higher number of urine marks than those exposed to a short-AGE) female. When tested after delivering a litter, long-AGD females displayed more tail-rattling (a component of agonistic behavior) towards intruders of both sexes in comparison to short-AGD females. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that females with a long AGE) are exposed to higher levels of Testosterone during fetal life than females with a short AGD. Although not related to AGD, other measures of maternal aggression were affected by postpartum day, sex of intruders and a female's infanticidal potential while a virgin. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {The anogenital distances (AGD) of newborn female house mice vary as a function of prior intrauterine position. Females with long AGDs are more likely to be derived from intrauterine positions adjacent to males (2M) than females not adjacent to males (0M). Females with a male on one side (1M) show intermediate AGDs. Hence the AGD reflects the degree of androgenization experienced by the female in utero and correlates with a number of androgen-dependent anatomical, physiological, and behavioral events in adulthood. This experiment tested the usefulness of AGD measurements of female house mice taken at weaning rather than at birth as an index of prior androgenization. The AGD was normalized for body weight at weaning to yield an anogenital distance index (AGDI). Intrauterine position (IUP) was determined by caesarian section. Pups were marked and reared by foster mothers. Comparison of AGDI showed that 0M females had a significantly lower mean AGDI score than 2M females and 1M females were intermediate. This confirmed that AGDI reflects prior IUP and can be used as an index of prenatal androgenization. While testing for responsiveness to male urine, a stimulus known to accelerate puberty, only females from the 1M and 2M positions differed from controls indicating that 0M females had already attained puberty. Choosing females from unknown IUPs with short-AGDIs, mid-AGDIs, and long AGDIs and treating them with either urine or saline on the nose for the 4 days after weaning yielded much the same response indicating that AGDI can also be used to preselect females for sensitivity to factors influencing puberty. These results demonstrate that some of the variability known to be related to intrauterine position can be predicted by AGDI, a relatively easy measure to acquire at weaning in commonly used laboratory rodents. Such preselection could reduce variability of experimental results in the conduct of studies related to rodent reproduction and may reduce the number of animals needed without loss of predictive ability.},

Variation in the acoustic structure of individual syllables within a call carries information regarding the extent of threat. Given this variation, along with the production of multiple syllables within a repeated call, the syntactical structure of the call could also encode meaningful information. To test for evidence of syntax in Richardson's ground squirrel alarm communication, we presented adult and juvenile subjects with repeated alarm calls with unaltered syllable order and those same calls with syllable order randomized. There was limited evidence that syllable order affected receiver response, but squirrels were more responsive to primary syllables of repeated calls even when these syllables were embedded within randomized calls. This suggests that primary syllables serve a general alerting function, possibly priming receivers for information that follows. Distinctive structural elements of primary syllables, including reduced syllable duration and reduced harmonic durations relative to the fundamental frequency, were correlated with the heightened vigilance responses that these syllables evoked.},

However, recently strains belonging to different species of Mus have been established from wild progenitors. These are an interesting addition to the arsenal of mouse geneticists, because they can be crossed with classical laboratory strains to produce viable and fertile offspring with a large number of polymorphisms of natural origin. These strains are helpful for making genome annotations because they permit highly refined genotype-phenotype correlations.

It remains unknown, however, whether changes in call rate communicate predator movements. That is, does an increasing call rate indicate an approaching predator and a decreasing rate the opposite? We presented free-living squirrels with moving predator models and recorded their responses. Vigilant behaviour increased more when predators approached versus retreated, suggesting that squirrels recognize the changes in threat associated with predator movements. Squirrels rarely produced alarm calls during these encounters, however, suggesting that squirrels do not rely entirely on alarm vocalizations to assess the threat posed by potential predators. Receivers of manipulated calls did not respond differentially to alarm calls containing an increasing or decreasing rate of syllable production. Thus, while rate may encode information about the extent of threat, Richardson's ground squirrels do not communicate predator movements via changes in call rate.},

abstract = {Among procellariiform seabirds, many burrowing petrels show good olfactory abilities especially in recognising their nest. In particular, it has been reported that Antarctic prions (Pachyptila desolata) discriminate their own and their mate's odours and, in Y-maze experiments, prefer the odour of a conspecific bird to their own. While traditionally examined from the perspective of homing mechanisms, these recent results have drawn attention to the possible use of chemical signals in birds' social behaviours. Indeed, the life history of petrels suggests that a mate choice mediated by olfactory mechanisms may have evolved in this group to ensure genetic compatibility. This study was undertaken to validate and extend results obtained on petrels' olfactory discrimination capabilities. Following the Y-maze experiment protocol, blue petrels (Halobaena caerulea) were offered three different choices: (1) mate versus conspecific's odour, (2) own versus mate's odour and (3) own versus conspecific's odour. We discovered that birds prefer the odour of their mate not only when presented against conspecific's odour but also against their own. We further verified that blue petrels also avoid their own odour when presented against conspecific's odour. Our results confirm that olfactory discrimination in burrowing petrels goes beyond self-recognition and that self-odour avoidance may be widespread.

abstract = {Neuropeptides, especially oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), have been implicated in several features of monogamy including alloparenting. The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of OT and AVP in alloparental behavior in reproductively naı̈ve male prairie voles. Males received intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), OT, an OT receptor antagonist (OTA), AVP, an AVP receptor antagonist (AVPA), or combinations of OTA and AVPA and were subsequently tested for parental behavior. Approximately 45 min after treatment, animals were tested for behavioral responses to stimulus pups. In a 10-min test, spontaneous alloparental behavior was high in control animals. OT and AVP did not significantly increase the number of males that showed parental behavior, although more subtle behavioral changes were observed. Combined treatment with AVPA and OTA (10 ng each) significantly reduced male parental behavior and increased attacks; following a lower dose (1 ng OTA/1 ng AVPA), males were less likely to display kyphosis and tended to be slower to approach pups than controls. Since treatment with only one antagonist did not interfere with the expression of alloparenting, these results suggest that access to either OT or AVP receptors may be sufficient for the expression of alloparenting.},

Other traits, such as age adult weight reached, age of dispersal, length of time of gestation, were significantly correlated with body size. A principal component analysis suggested that the complex of life-history traits could be reduced to four components: body size (=weight), seasonality, specific reproductive effort, and maturity. The variation in the sociality index was best explained by age of first reproduction and age adult weight reached. Generally, species are more social when large body size combined with a relatively short growing season is associated with delayed dispersal and occurs in those species typically breeding for the first time at age two or older. Sociality in these species may have evolved through retention of daughters within the maternal home range as a means of continuing reproductive investment beyond weaning.},

abstract = {Social avoidance and social phobia are core symptoms of various psychopathologies but their underlying etiology remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aims to reveal pro-social effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), under both basal and stress-induced social avoidance conditions in rodents using a social preference paradigm. We initially show that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) application of an OT receptor antagonist (OTR-A) in na{\"{i}}ve male rats (0.75 $\mu$g/5 $\mu$l), or mice (20 $\mu$g/2 $\mu$l), reduced social exploration of a novel con-specific indicative of attenuated social preference. Previous exposure of male rats to a single social defeat resulted in loss of their social preference and social avoidance, which could be restored by i.c.v. infusion of synthetic OT (0.1 $\mu$g/5 $\mu$l) 20 min before the social preference test. Although the amygdala has been implicated in both social and OT-mediated actions, bilateral OTR-A (0.1 $\mu$g/1 $\mu$l) or OT (0.01 $\mu$g/1 $\mu$l) administration into various subnuclei of the amygdala did not affect basal or stress-induced social preference behavior, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the social specificity of these OT-mediated effects by showing that neither an arginine vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist (0.75 $\mu$g/5 $\mu$l, i.c.v.) nor the anxiogenic drug pentylenetetrazol (15 mg/kg, i.p.) altered social preference, with OTR-A not affecting non-social anxiety on the elevated plus-maze. Overall, the data indicate that the basal activity of the endogenous brain OT system is sufficient to promote natural occurring social preference in rodents while synthetic OT shows potential to reverse stress-induced social avoidance and might thus be of use for treating social phobia and social dysfunction in humans.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is one of the few areas of the rodent brain that continues to produce neurons postnatally. Neurogenesis reportedly persists in rats up to 11 months of age. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, the present study confirms that in the adult rat brain, neuronal progenitor cells divide at the border between the hilus and the granule cell layer (GCL). In adult rats, the progeny of these cells migrate into the GCL and express the neuronal markers NeuN and calbindin-D28k. However, neurogenesis was drastically reduced in aged rats. Six-to 27-month-old Fischer rats were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU to detect newborn cells in vivo and to follow their fate in the dentate gyrus. When killed 4-6 weeks after BrdU labeling, 12- to 27-month-old rats exhibited a significant decline in the density of BrdU-positive cells in the granule cell layer compared with 6-month-old controls. Decreased neurogenesis in aging rats was accompanied by reduced immunoreactivity for poly-sialylated neural cell adhesion molecule, a molecule that is involved in migration and process elongation of developing neurons. When animals were killed immediately (12 hr) after BrdU injection, significantly fewer labeled cells were observed in the GCL and adjacent subgranular zone of aged rats, indicative of a decrease in mitotic activity of neuronal precursor cells. The reduced proliferation was not attributable to a general aged-related metabolic impairment, because the density of BrdU-positive cells was not altered in other brain regions with known mitotic activity (e.g., hilus and lateral ventricle wall). The decline in neurogenesis that occurs throughout the lifespan of an animal can thus be related to a decreasing proliferation of granule cell precursors.},

We observed exclusive space use among females but not among males. For both males and females, individual home ranges (85{\%} minimum convex polygons) typically overlapped with .1 animal of the opposite sex. No significant differences in body mass, hind-foot length, or home-range size (area) were found between males and females. Most individuals in the population nested alone. Patterns of space use and sexual dimorphism are frequently used to infer species' mating systems. Our results, in particular the tendency for individual home ranges to overlap with multiple potential reproductive partners, are most consistent with a promiscuous mating system.},

Pheromones have been classified as molecules released by individuals and responsible for the elicitation of specific behavioral expressions in members of the same species. These signaling molecules, often chemically unrelated, are contained in body fluids like urine, sweat, specialized exocrine glands, and mucous secretions of genitals. The standard view of pheromone sensing was based on the assumption that most mammals have two separated olfactory systems with different functional roles: the main olfactory system for recognizing conventional odorant molecules and the vomeronasal system specifically dedicated to the detection of pheromones. However, recent studies have reexamined this traditional interpretation showing that both the main olfactory and the vomeronasal systems are actively involved in pheromonal communication. The current knowledge on the behavioral, physiological, and molecular aspects of pheromone detection in mammals is discussed in this review.

abstract = {The formation of social attachments is a critical component of human relationships. Infants begin to bond to their caregivers from the moment of birth, and these social bonds continue to provide regulatory emotional functions throughout adulthood. It is difficult to examine the interactions between social experience and the biological origins of these complex behaviors because children undergo both brain development and accumulate social experience at the same time. We had a rare opportunity to examine children who were reared in extremely aberrant social environments where they were deprived of the kind of care-giving typical for our species. The present experiment in nature provides insight into the role of early experience on the brain systems underlying the development of emotional behavior. These data indicate that the vasopressin and oxytocin neuropeptide systems, which are critical in the establishment of social bonds and the regulation of emotional behaviors, are affected by early social experience. The results of this experiment suggest a potential mechanism whose atypical function may explain the pervasive social and emotional difficulties observed in many children who have experienced aberrant care-giving. The present findings are consistent with the view that there is a critical role for early experience in the development of the brain systems underlying basic aspects of human social behavior.},

abstract = {Rat ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are ethologically-essential social signals. Under natural conditions, 22kHz USVs and 50kHz USVs are emitted in association with negative and positive emotional states, respectively. Our first experiment examined freezing behavior elicited in na{\"{i}}ve Sprague-Dawley rats by a 22kHz USV, a 50kHz USV, and frequency-matched tones. None of the stimuli elicited freezing, which is the most commonly-used index of fear. The second experiment examined single-unit responses to these stimuli in the amygdala (AM), which is well-known for its role in innate and acquired fear responses. Among 127 well-discriminated single units, 82{\%} were auditory-responsive. Elicited firing patterns were classified using a multi-dimensional scheme that included transient (phasic) responses to the stimulus onsets and/or offsets as well as sustained (tonic) responses during the stimulus. Tonic responses, which are not ordinarily evaluated in AM, were 4.4-times more common than phasic responses. The 22kHz stimuli tended to elicit tonic increases in the firing rates, whereas the 50kHz stimuli more often elicited tonic decreases in firing rates. These opposing tonic responses correspond with the ethological valence of USVs in the two frequency bands. Thus, a relatively-small sample of single-unit responses in AM furnished a more sensitive index of emotional valence than freezing behavior. Latency analysis suggested that stimuli in the two frequency bands are processed through different pathways to AM. One possible interpretation is that phasic responses in AM reflect the detection of a stimulus change, whereas tonic responses indicate the valence of the detected stimulus.},

abstract = {Arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) influence social behavior and cognitive processes and may explain some of the variance associated with individual differences in behavior. Although great focus has been placed on the roles of these peptides in learning and memory, less attention has been given to the receptors to which they bind. The authors exposed male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) to novel females in a multitrial social recognition test to investigate whether individual differences in vasopressin receptor (V1aR) or oxytocin receptor (OTR) related to social recognition. The authors also explored differences in OTR and V1aR throughout the brain to determine whether patterns of receptor coexpression emerged in functionally related structures. Male investigation of females was highly variable, and those that investigated females the most did not habituate to repeated female presentation. Moreover, high investigators expressed significantly more V1aR and less OTR in the lateral septum. Coexpression patterns of these receptors emphasize the role of OT and AVP in neural circuits involved in social behavior, reward, learning, and memory. Understanding individual differences in the laboratory may provide insight into evolved natural behavior.},

abstract = {Cortical neuroscience is founded on studies of a very few model organisms, mainly rats, cats, and macaque monkeys. The concentration of effort on such a few species would be defensible if cortical organization were basically uniform across mammals, as is commonly believed. Although there is little reason to doubt that some features of cortical organization are indeed widespread among mammals, phyletic variation in cortical organization is far more extensive than has generally been appreciated or acknowledged. Rats, for example, differ from other mammals in the genetics and chemistry of their cortical neurons, in connectivity and areal organization, and in the functions of specific cortical regions. Likewise, macaque monkeys, although widely used as models of the human visual system, lack a number of features found in human visual cortex. Given the variability of cortical organization, how should neuroscientists approach the study of nonhuman species, and what can we reasonably expect to learn from them? First, by examining a wider range of species than are currently employed, and by using modern techniques of phyletic analysis, neuroscientists can more rigorously identify those features of cortical organization that are, in fact, widely shared among mammals or among particular mammalian subgroups. Second, by taking account of variations, neuroscientists can abstract more reliable and general principles of structure-function relationships in the nervous system. Finally, freed from the doctrine of basic uniformity, neuroscientists can pursue the study of human cortical specializations, and so advance our understanding of what distinguishes humans as a biological species.},

We presented free-living adult and juvenile RGS with playbacks of repetitive alarm calls from one vs. two juvenile callers broadcast sequentially through two spatially separated loudspeakers. Adult RGS spent a greater proportion of time vigilant in response to two vs. one calling squirrel, whereas juvenile RGS did not respond differentially to two vs. one caller. Apparently then, the relative inexperience of juvenile RGS with alarm calls and the context in which such calls are emitted precludes their enumeration of alarm callers. Taken together with our earlier finding that adult but not juvenile RGS ignore information regarding response urgency encoded in the rate of juvenile produced repetitive calls, our present results suggest a developmental shift in response-urgency perception. Adult RGS selectively extract information regarding response urgency via discrimination of the number of callers, ignoring less reliable information encoded in the rate of repetitive calls issued by inexperienced juvenile signallers.},

abstract = {The vomeronasal receptor 1 (V1R) are believed to be pheromone receptors in rodents. Here we used computational methods to identify 95 and 62 new putative V1R genes from the draft rat and mouse genome sequence, respectively. The rat V1R repertoire consists of 11 subfamilies, 10 of which are shared with the mouse, while rat appears to lack the H and I subfamilies found in mouse and possesses one unique subfamily (M). The estimations of the relative divergence times suggest that many subfamilies originated after the split of rodents and primates. The analysis also reveals that these clusters underwent an expansion very close to the split of mouse and rat. In addition, maximum likelihood analysis showed that the nonsynonymous and synonymous rate ratio for most of these clusters was much higher than one, suggesting the role of positive selection in the diversification of these duplicated V1R genes. Because V1R are thought to mediate the process of signal transduction in response to pheromone detection, we speculate that the V1R genes have evolved under positive Darwinian selection to maintain the ability to discriminate between large and complex pheromonal mixtures. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

Here, we review the increasing body of evidence that exogenously administered and endogenously released OT and AVP can activate each other's canonical receptors (i.e., cross-talk) and examine the possibility that receptor cross-talk following the synaptic and non-synaptic release of OT and AVP contributes to their distinct roles in the brain and periphery.

abstract = {Most species have predominant forms of social and reproductive behavior driven by many years of selection pressures and evolution. For example, rodent species can live in small or large groups, behave more tolerant or aggressively toward conspecifics (including newborns), and form or not bonds with other members of the group (including sexual partners). Any of those behavioral adaptations could result in good fitness for the species, but could also require compromises such as sharing resources, greater parental investment, increased risk of predation, etc. We propose that the oxytocin (OXT) system, among others neuroendocrine peptides, is at the basis of a neural mechanism that adapts and predisposes species to a particular social and reproductive form of living. In this review we will show evidence that the variability in the density of receptors for OXT (OXTR) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the lateral septum (LS) predisposes species to adopt at least 4 different social and reproductive strategies in rodents. Large or medium size groups with lower conspecific spacing (preferred separation distance maintained by adult conspecifics), and high levels of promiscuity are characterized by low levels of OXTR in the NAc and LS (e.g. Ratus norvegicus, Ctenomys sociabilis, Scotinomys teguina, Cavia porcellus); small size groups with higher conspecific spacing and low levels of promiscuity are characterized by high OXTR in the NAc and the LS (e.g. Peromyscus californicus); large or medium groups with lower conspecific spacing and low levels of promiscuity characterized by high levels of OXTR in the NAc but low levels in the LS (e.g. Microtus ochrogaster, Heterocephalus glaber, Microtus kikuchii); and small or medium size groups with higher conspecific spacing and high levels of promiscuity characterized by low levels of OXTR in the NAc and high OXTR in the LS (e.g. Mus musculus, Ctenomys haigi, Peromyscus maniculatus, Microtus pennsylvanicus, Microtus montanus). Careful analysis of the distribution of OXTR, and other peptides receptors, in the brain can contribute to understand its function but also to predict reproductive and social strategies of species.},

abstract = {One contribution of 18 to a theme issue 'The evolution of cooperation based on direct fitness benefits'. Many bats are extremely social. In some cases, individuals remain together for years or even decades and engage in mutually beneficial behaviours among non-related individuals. Here, we summarize ways in which unrelated bats cooperate while roosting, foraging, feeding or caring for offspring. For each situation, we ask if cooperation involves an investment, and if so, what mech-anisms might ensure a return. While some cooperative outcomes are likely a by-product of selfish behaviour as they are in many other vertebrates, we explain how cooperative investments can occur in several situations and are particularly evident in food sharing among common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and alloparental care by greater spear-nosed bats (Phyllostomus hastatus). Fieldwork and experiments on vampire bats indicate that sharing blood with non-kin expands the number of possible donors beyond kin and promotes reciprocal help by strengthening long-term social bonds.

abstract = {All nonhuman primates communicate with conspecifics using vocalizations, a system involving both the production and perception of species-specific vocal signals. Much of the work on the neural basis of primate vocal communication in cortex has focused on the sensory processing of vocalizations, while relatively little data are available for vocal production. Earlier physiological studies in squirrel monkeys had shed doubts on the involvement of primate cortex in vocal behaviors. The aim of the present study was to identify areas of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) cortex that are potentially involved in vocal communication. In this study, we quantified cFos expression in three areas of marmoset cortex – frontal, temporal (auditory) and medial temporal – under various vocal conditions. Specifically, we examined cFos expression in these cortical areas during the sensory, motor (vocal production) and sensory-motor components of vocal communication. Our results showed an increase in cFos expression in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex as well as the medial and lateral belt areas of auditory cortex in the vocal perception condition. In contrast, subjects in the vocal production condition resulted in increased cFos expression only in dorsal premotor cortex. During the sensory-motor condition (antiphonal calling), subjects exhibited cFos expression in each of the above areas, as well as increased expression in perirhinal cortex. Overall, these results suggest that various cortical areas outside primary auditory cortex are involved in primate vocal communication. These findings pave the way for further physiological studies of the neural basis of primate vocal communication.},

abstract = {The numbers of functional olfactory receptor (OR) genes in humans and mice are about 400 and 1,000 respectively. In both humans and mice, these genes exist as genomic clusters and are scattered over almost all chromosomes. The difference in the number of genes between the two species is apparently caused by massive inactivation of OR genes in the human lineage and a substantial increase of OR genes in the mouse lineage after the human-mouse divergence. Compared with mammals, fishes have a much smaller number of OR genes. However, the OR gene family in fishes is much more divergent than that in mammals. Fishes have many different groups of genes that are absent in mammals, suggesting that the mammalian OR gene family is characterized by the loss of many group genes that existed in the ancestor of vertebrates and the subsequent expansion of specific groups of genes. Therefore, this gene family apparently changed dynamically depending on the evolutionary lineage and evolved under the birth-and-death model of evolution. Study of the evolutionary changes of two gene families for vomeronasal receptors and two gene families for taste receptors, which are structurally similar, but remotely related to OR genes, showed that some of the gene families evolved in the same fashion as the OR gene family. It appears that the number and types of genes in chemosensory receptor gene families have evolved in response to environmental needs, but they are also affected by fortuitous factors.},

abstract = {Seasonally breeding animals oftentimes alter their social interactions as a result of the shift from a long-day to short-day photoperiod. When this occurs, behaviours and corresponding affiliations with conspecifics will change as well. Consequently, individuals may react differently towards signals made by conspecifics as a result of this seasonal shift. We examined the responses of short photoperiod (SP) male and female meadow voles to the over-marks of two opposite-sex conspecifics that were born and raised in the same or in a different photoperiod. We tested the hypothesis that seasonal differences exist in the responses of voles to the top- and bottom-scent donors of a same-sex over-mark. We predicted that SP voles would not spend more time investigating the mark of the top-scent donor than that of bottom-scent donor of an over-mark; a response that is different from that of long photoperiod (LP) meadow voles to the mark of the top- and bottom-scent donors of an over-mark. After exposure to various over-mark treatments, SP male subjects later spent more time investigating the mark of the SP female that provided the top-scent mark to that of the SP female that provided the bottom-scent mark and more time investigating the mark of the top-scent LP female than that of bottom-scent SP female, but they spent similar amounts of time investigating the mark of the top-scent SP female and that of the bottom-scent SP female. In contrast, SP females spent similar amounts of time investigating the mark of the top-scent LP male and that of the bottom-scent SP male, the mark of the top-scent SP male and that of the bottom-scent LP male, and the mark of the top-scent LP male and that of the bottom-scent LP male. The data provide mixed support for the hypothesis, indicating that sex differences exist in the response of SP meadow voles to the marks of the top- and bottom-scent donors of an over-mark. This suggests that the responses of voles to over-marks of donors from the same photoperiods vary seasonally for females but not for males. The sex differences in the response of voles to over-marks may depend on their reproductive state as well as the reproductive state of the donors and the position of the donor's scent marks in the over-mark.},

Saturation studies performed on rat brain septal membranes demonstrated that125I-Linear AVP antagonist binds to a single class of sites with high affinity (55 pM) and limited capacity (88 fmol/mg protein). In autoradiographic studies,125I-Linear AVP antagonist labeled brain areas known to contain vasopressin receptors without binding to neurophysins.125I-Linear AVP antagonist also labeled sites in cortex, hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra. In competition studies,125I-Linear AVP antagonist binding was most readily blocked by AVP and a selective V1aagonist. Oxytocin and a selective V2ligand were effective only in micromolar concentrations. A selective oxytocin agonist was virtually ineffective in blocking125I-Linear AVP antagonist binding. In regions that contain a high density of oxytocin binding sites, however, oxytocin-displaceable binding was observed. In agreement with studies on peripheral tissues, the binding profile generated from these studies indicates that125I-Linear AVP antagonist binds to vasopressin receptors of the V1asubtype. These results suggest that125I-Linear AVP antagonist is a valuable ligand for the study of central AVP receptors. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Animals are known to recognize a specific odorant informing conspecific health condition, which plays a significant role in regulating their social communication. Here, we assess neural mechanisms regulating innate approach/avoidance response toward such conspecific odor cues in rats. Odor scent from healthy conspecifics induced approach behavior, while those from sick conspecifics produced avoidance response in odor-recipient male rats. Analysis of mRNA expression in several brain sites of odor recipient rats illustrated that induction of c-fos mRNA expression was found in the olfactory bulb (OB), the medial amygdala (MeA), the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BnST), and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), when exposed to conspecific odor. Moreover, in the MeA, expression of oxytocin (OT) receptor mRNA was increased when rats were exposed to healthy conspecific odor, while induction of arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor 1a and 1b mRNA were found only when exposed to sick conspecific odor. Bilateral infusion of OT receptor (OTR) antagonist, (d(CH2)51,Tyr(Me)2,Thr4,Orn8,des-Gly-NH29)-Vasotocin, into the MeA blocked approach behavior to healthy odor, while those of AVP receptor antagonists, V1a selective: (Phenylac1,D-Tyr(Me)2,Arg6.8,Lys-NH29)-Vasopressin, and type 1 receptor antagonist: (Deamino-Pen1, Try(Me)2, Arg8)-Vasopressin, into the MeA inhibited avoidance response to sick odor. These findings provide evidence for an essential role of OT and AVP receptors, especially type 1a, in the MeA in regulating approach/avoidance behaviors, respectively, in social odorant communication.},

abstract = {The development of social familiarity in rodents depends predominantly on olfactory cues and can critically influence reproductive success. Researchers have operationally defined this memory by a reliable decrease in olfactory investigation in repeated or prolonged encounters with a conspecific. Brain oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) seem to modulate a range of social behaviour from parental care to mate guarding. Pharmacological studies indicate that AVP administration may enhance social memory, whereas OT administration may either inhibit or facilitate social memory depending on dose, route or paradigm.We found that male mice mutant for the oxytocin gene (Oxt-/-) failed to develop social memory, whereas wild-type (Oxt+/+) mice showed intact social memory. Measurement of both olfactory foraging and olfactory habituation tasks indicated that olfactory detection of non-social stimuli is intact in Oxt-/- mice. Spatial memory and behavioural inhibition measured in a Morris water-maze, Y-maze, or habituation of an acoustic startle also seemed intact. Treatment with OT but not AVP rescued social memory in Oxt-/- mice, and treatment with an OT antagonist produced a social amnesia-like effect in Oxt+/+ mice. Our data indicate that OT is necessary for the normal development of social memory in mice and support the hypothesis that social memory has a neural basis distinct from other forms of memory.},

Compared to vehicle and scrambled-sequence oligo controls, chronic antisense administration for up to 4 d diminished the ability of the animals to distinguish a previously exposed juvenile from a novel one and to respond to exogenous AVP (1 ng/5 microliters, intracerebroventricular) with an improved social memory. Furthermore, anxiety-related behavior was reduced. As measured in the behaviorally tested rats, antisense treatment resulted in a reduced binding of radiolabeled AVP in the septum, but not in other limbic brain areas (receptor autoradiography), and an increased amount of V1 receptor mRNA (reverse transcriptase PCR), indicating translational arrest and ongoing transcriptional activity. In sense oligo-treated rats, on the other hand, both the social and the anxiety-related behavior scores lay between levels obtained in control and antisense-treated animals. These sense-treated rats showed a slightly reduced V1 receptor density in the septum and reduced receptor mRNA levels, indicating hybridization of the sense oligo to the DNA. The data show the potential of antisense targeting to further reveal relationships between local gene expression, neuropeptide-receptor interactions in distinct brain areas, and behavioral performance.},

abstract = {Vasopressin (Avp) is mainly synthesized in the magnocellular cells of the hypothalamic supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) whose axons project to the posterior pituitary. Avp is then released into the blood stream upon appropriate stimulation (e.g., hemorrhage or dehydration) to act at the kidneys and blood vessels. The brain also contains several populations of smaller, parvocellular neurons whose projections remain within the brain. These populations are located within the PVN, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), medial amygdala (MeA) and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Since the 1950s, research examining the roles of Avp in the brain and periphery has intensified. The development of specific agonists and antagonists for Avp receptors has allowed for a better elucidation of its contributions to physiology and behavior. Anatomical, pharmacological and transgenic, including “knockout,” animal studies have implicated Avp in the regulation of various social behaviors across species. Avp plays a prominent role in the regulation of aggression, generally of facilitating or promoting it. Affiliation and certain aspects of pair-bonding are also influenced by Avp. Memory, one of the first brain functions of Avp that was investigated, has been implicated especially strongly in social recognition. The roles of Avp in stress, anxiety, and depressive states are areas of active exploration. In this review, we concentrate on the scientific progress that has been made in understanding the role of Avp in regulating these and other behaviors across species. We also discuss the implications for human behavior.},

abstract = {The neuropeptides vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) and their receptors in the brain are involved in the regulation of various social behaviors and have emerged as drug targets for the treatment of social dysfunction in several sex-biased neuropsychiatric disorders. Sex differences in the VP and OT systems may therefore be implicated in sex-specific regulation of healthy as well as impaired social behaviors. We begin this review by highlighting the sex differences, or lack of sex differences, in VP and OT synthesis in the brain. We then discuss the evidence showing the presence or absence of sex differences in VP and OT receptors in rodents and humans, as well as showing new data of sexually dimorphic V1a receptor binding in the rat brain. Importantly, we find that there is lack of comprehensive analysis of sex differences in these systems in common laboratory species, and we find that, when sex differences are present, they are highly brain region- and species-specific. Interestingly, VP system parameters (VP and V1aR) are typically higher in males, while sex differences in the OT system are not always in the same direction, often showing higher OT expression in females, but higher OT receptor expression in males. Furthermore, VP and OT receptor systems show distinct and largely non-overlapping expression in the rodent brain, which may cause these receptors to have either complementary or opposing functional roles in the sex-specific regulation of social behavior. Though still in need of further research, we close by discussing how manipulations of the VP and OT systems have given important insights into the involvement of these neuropeptide systems in the sex-specific regulation of social behavior in rodents and humans.},

abstract = {Cheek-marking in yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) was studied by observations of cheek-marking in two colonies from 10 June to 6 August, 1996 and by experimental studies of responses to olfactory secretions from the perioral gland. The rate of cheek-marking declined significantly as the season progressed. Most cheek-marking occurred within 3 m of the main burrow system and was primarily associated with sitting or lying and short locomotory bouts around the main burrow area. Cheek-marking rates of individuals differed significantly and adults appeared to mark more than yearlings. In the experiment, marmots cheek-marked stakes with perioral secretions significantly more than stakes without secretions. However, they marked unfamiliar and familiar smells equally. Marmots investigated strange secretions longer than familiar secretions and familiar secretions longer than the blank treatment. Functionally, cheek-marking is a multipurpose activity. It provides cues for young of the year to learn the safe areas in the home range, imparts familiarity with the burrow area, communicates burrow occupancy, and functions in territorial defense.},

abstract = {The olfactory system typically consists of two parallel systems: the main olfactory system and the accessory olfactory system. The main olfactory bulb (MOB) acts as the initial processing site for volatile chemical stimuli and receives input from the olfactory receptor cells located in the olfactory epithelium. The African giant rat is reputed to have abilities to detect landmines and tuberculosis samples by sniffing. This study therefore is a preliminary study on the histological and immunohistochemical anatomy of the olfactory bulb of the African giant rat (Cricetomys gambianus, Waterhouse). Nissl and Kl{\"{u}}ver-Barrera histological staining of the olfactory bulb revealed a cytoarchitecture typical of most mammals with 6 cell layers, and 1-2-layered glomeruli measuring approximately 150 $\mu$m each in diameter. Immunohistochemical staining with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) revealed cellular conformations relative to most mammals. GFAP immunohistochemistry also revealed cell bodies and processes within the periglomerular area which may potentiate signaling from the olfactory receptor cells, while CNPase largely showed soma and evidence of myelin sheath deposition, confirming myelination at different layers of the bulb. Neurogenesis was examined using the neurogenic markers doublecortin (DCX) and Ki-67. Migration of newly generated cells was observed in all layers of the MOB with DCX and in most layers with Ki-67. The anatomy of the olfactory bulb is described as relatively large in the African giant rat, having a neuroarchitecture similar to most rodents.},

@article{Ryan2002,
abstract = {A review of the literature suggests that individual variability in sex-related traits may be influenced by variations in hormonal exposure during fetal development. In litter-bearing mammals, fetuses develop in utero and may be subjected to differing hormonal environments based upon the sex of neighboring fetuses. Female fetuses developing between two males tend to show masculinized anatomical, physiological and behavioral traits as adults. Female fetuses developing without adjacent males, on the other hand, tend to show more feminized traits as adults. These traits include permanently altered hormone levels, reproductive organs, aggressive behaviors, secondary sex ratios and susceptibility to endocrine disruption. This intrauterine effect is due to the transfer of testosterone from male fetuses to adjacent fetuses. While these effects have been most clearly demonstrated in mice, other rodents and swine also show intrauterine position (IUP) effects. Some of these effects are similar to the influence of prenatal stress on adult phenotypes. A few reports on human twins suggest that variability in some masculine and feminine traits may be due to intrauterine hormonal signals. IUP effects may impact a number of scientific fields of research such as endocrine disruption, toxicology, population biology, animal production and health.},

abstract = {After pair-bonding, male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) display aggression toward novel females but not toward their female partner. Here we show that this selective aggression in pair-bonded male prairie voles is associated with increased release of vasopressin (AVP) in the anterior hypothalamus (AH). Pharmacological activation of AVP-V1a receptors (V1aR) in the AH induced selective aggression in sexually naive males, whereas V1aR blockade diminished selective aggression in pair-bonded males. Pair-bonded males also showed an increased density in V1aR binding in the AH compared to their sexually naive counterparts and overexpression of V1aR in the AH, by viral vector-mediated gene transfer, facilitated aggression toward novel females. These data demonstrate that AH-AVP is both necessary and sufficient in the regulation of selective aggression associated with pair-bonding. In the second part of this study, we examined the effects of amphetamine (AMPH) exposure on female-directed aggression and revealed the potential role of AH-AVP underlying this behavior. Repeated AMPH administration in sexually naive male prairie voles enhanced V1aR expression in the AH and induced aggression toward a familiar or unfamiliar female. In addition, this AMPH-induced aggression was blocked by intra-AH administration of a V1aR antagonist. Together, our data reveal a socioneurobiological mechanism, highlighting a critical role of AH-AVP in the regulation of aggression induced by pair-bonding or drug experience in socially monogamous male prairie voles.},

While we know that intra-uterine position and litter sex ratio influence anogenital distance, there are other, heretofore unstudied, factors that could influence anogenital distance, including maternal effects. We capitalized on a long-term study of wild yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) to study the importance of maternal effects on explaining variation in anogenital distance and found significant effects. The strength of these effects varied annually. Taken together, our data highlights the strong variability due to environmental effects, and illustrates the importance of additive genetic and maternal genetic effects on neonatal anogenital distance. We suspect that, as others apply recently popularised quantitative genetic techniques to study free-living populations, such effects will be identified in other systems.},

The spatial association between young breeding females and their mothers was studied in five 2500-m2 enclosures in natural habitats during mid- and late breeding season in summer 1992. The mothers (founder females) were introduced into the enclosures in the beginning of the study in June, whereas the young breeding females were born within the enclosures. Matrilineal kinship was determined by using radionuclides. In July-August, 58{\%} of young breeding females were philopatric, but 82{\%} of the mother-daughter associations broke up until August-September. Of the young females that started to breed in August-September, only 12{\%} were philopatric. Thus the kin clusters found were short lived and few in number during the late breeding season. The reduction in the incidence of the kin clusters coincided with an increase of population density. The mean reproductive success of females breeding in kin clusters was better than that of those breeding separately. In addition, among the nonphilopatric females there was a positive, significant correlation between reproductive success and the distance to the nearest unrelated founder female. Such correlation was not found among the philopatric females.},

abstract = {In rodents, steroids are able to pass between fetuses. Although not previously examined in mice, we have provided evidence that blood flow in the uterine loop artery in rats is bidirectional and that steroids are transported between fetuses by diffusion via the uterine lumen, not via the uterine blood vessels of the mother. The direction of blood flow in the uterine loop artery and vein feeding each uterine horn in house mice was examined on day 17 of pregnancy. Dye was injected into the heart to determine the direction of blood flow in the uterine artery while injection of dye into individual placentae was used to determine the direction of blood flow in the uterine vein. Blood entered the loop artery from both the dorsal and caudal ends and was thus bidirectional. Venus blood flow from placentae was in a rostral direction from placentae in the rostral portion of a uterine horn and in a caudal direction from placentae in the caudal portion of a uterine horn. Comparison of anogenital distance and body weight at birth using a variety of classification schemes, based on different assumptions about the mechanism and direction of transport of steroids between fetuses, showed that the only scheme which accounted for variation in anogenital distance at birth in female mice was that which was based on the number of directly adjacent male siblings in utero. Taken together with recent findings in rats reported elsewhere, we conclude that blood flow in the uterine blood vessels is bidirectional, and steroids are transported between fetuses by diffusing through the amniotic fluid and across the fetal membranes of adjacent fetuses. We found that the common method of using the ratio of anogenital distance/body weight can lead to erroneous conclusions concerning intrauterine position effects on anogenital distance. Analysis of covariance tests whether variation in body weight contributes to differences in anogenital distance due to intrauterine position, and this method of analysis should be used in future studies. ?? 1992.},

For this, the intrauterine position (IUP) of a female offspring from unilaterally ovariectomized, multiparous mothers was determined by their birth order. Depending on the sex of the adjacent fetuses, pups were divided into 4 groups: 1. Males. 2. 2??M females (females with 2 adjacent males), 1??M females (females with 1 male neighbor), and 0??M females (females with zero adjacent male). Pups' anogenital distance (AGD) was measured at birth and on Day 180 postpartum, when spontaneous chin marking activity was also measured. Our results revealed that AGD was a reliable indicator of sex as male pups had larger AGD than females, both at birth and later on. Adjacent male fetuses had significant effect: the more adjacent male fetuses females have had the longer AGD they possessed. AGD at birth was a good predictor of AGD and behavior of adults, as 2??M does showed the longest AGD and the highest chin marking activity among females. We concluded that, similarly to rodents, proximity to males in utero affects both anatomy and behavior in rabbits. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The study was carried out in four 0.25-ha enclosures (two control and two experimental), each situated on natural pasture. This study was conducted between August 1997 and March 1999 and had two parts: removal of overwintering male (ROM) and removal of overwintering female (ROF). For the ROM treatment overwintering males were removed immediately after the first cohort of juveniles were born, in the ROF treatment overwintering females were removed after the first cohort were weaned. Weekly censuses were taken for three successive days over 6 weeks. The sexual maturation and reproductive condition of juveniles were compared between treatments (overwintering male or female removal) using repeated-measures anova. The repeated measures factor was the age of juveniles. Removal of overwintering males and females did not affect sexual maturation of juveniles, however, overwintering males influenced the onset of reproductive activity of juvenile females at the beginning of the breeding period. {\textcopyright} 2006 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract = {Scent over-marking occurs when an animal places its scent mark directly on top of another individual's scent mark. However, situations may arise in which the top- and bottom-scent donors of an over-mark differ in an individual characteristic(s), for example, gonadal hormone titres. We tested the hypothesis that adult meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, preferentially respond to a gonadectomized donor treated with gonadal steroid hormones over a gonadectomized donor not treated with gonadal steroid hormones, independently of the position of the scent marks in an over-mark. Male meadow voles spent more time investigating the scent marks of gonadectomized females treated with oestradiol than that of gonadectomized females treated with no oestradiol, independently of the position of the two scent marks in the over-mark. Female voles spent more time investigating the scent marks of gonadectomized males treated with testosterone than that of gonadectomized males treated with no testosterone, only when the former males were the top- scent donors. These results suggest that male meadow voles appear to base their preference on the oestradiol titre of females, rather than the position of the female's mark in an over-mark. In contrast, female meadow voles appear to use both the position of the male's scent mark in an over-mark and the male's testosterone titre for the basis of their preference.

abstract = {Several studies suggest a role for arginine vasopressin (AVP), particularly in the lateral septum, in the regulation of intermale aggression. We used intracerebral microdialysis to monitor the local in vivo AVP release within the mediolateral septum of adult male Wistar rats bred for low (LAB) or high (HAB) anxiety-related behaviour during exposure to the resident-intruder test. LAB residents showed a significantly higher level of aggression than HAB residents, as reflected by more time spent with lateral threat, offensive upright and total aggressive behaviour as well as by more attacks and a shorter attack latency. Septal AVP release was significantly decreased in high-aggressive LAB males, while septal AVP release tended to increase in HAB males during resident-intruder test exposure. Moreover, LAB residents showed reduced neuronal activation of the lateral septum, as indicated by fewer c-Fos-positive cells, 1 h after the resident-intruder test. Pharmacological manipulation of the septal AVP system by local application of either synthetic AVP to LAB residents or the selective V1a receptor antagonist d(CH(2))(5)Tyr(Me)AVP to HAB residents did not change the level of aggression. However, application of AVP into the septum enhanced anxiety-related behaviour on the elevated plus-maze in LAB males, while local administration of the V1a receptor antagonist reduced social investigation in HAB males during the resident-intruder test. In conclusion, although AVP release patterns within the septum are dependent on the level of aggression, locally released AVP does not seem to be directly involved in the regulation of aggression, but rather modulates non-aggressive social and anxiety-related behaviours.},

To gain insight into the neural mechanisms underlying this ability, we imaged responses of mouse olfactory bulb glomeruli to mixtures. We used this data to build a model of mixture responses that incorporated nonlinear interactions and trial-to-trial variability and explored potential decoding mechanisms that can mimic mouse performance when given glomerular responses as input. We find that a linear decoder with sparse weights could match mouse performance using just a small subset of the glomeruli (???15). However, when such a decoder is trained only with single odors, it generalizes poorly to mixture stimuli due to nonlinear mixture responses. We show that mice similarly fail to generalize, suggesting that they learn this segregation task discriminatively by adjusting task-specific decision boundaries without taking advantage of a demixed representation of odors.},

Basal plasma values were 1.7 pg/ml in Wistar rat, and 2.4 pg/ml in dog.

The response to the various stimuli was similar in Brattleboro rats, heterozygous for hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus, and in Wistar rats. In Brattleboro rats, homozygous for hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus, AVP was neither detectable in plasma nor in CSF. In dog and man, AVP levels in CSF samples were higher than in simultaneously obtained plasma samples.

abstract = {The olfactory (OR) and vomeronasal receptor (VR) repertoires are collectively encoded by 1700 genes and pseudogenes in the mouse genome. Most OR and VR genes were identified by comparative genomic techniques and therefore, in many of those cases, only their protein coding sequences are defined. Some also lack experimental support, due in part to the similarity between them and their monogenic, cell-specific expression in olfactory tissues. Here we use deep RNA sequencing, expression microarray and quantitative RT-PCR in both the vomeronasal organ and whole olfactory mucosa to quantify their full transcriptomes in multiple male and female mice. We find evidence of expression for all VR, and almost all OR genes that are annotated as functional in the reference genome, and use the data to generate over 1100 new, multi-exonic, significantly extended receptor gene annotations. We find that OR and VR genes are neither equally nor randomly expressed, but have reproducible distributions of abundance in both tissues. The olfactory transcriptomes are only minimally different between males and females, suggesting altered gene expression at the periphery is unlikely to underpin the striking sexual dimorphism in olfactory-mediated behavior. Finally, we present evidence that hundreds of novel, putatively protein-coding genes are expressed in these highly specialized olfactory tissues, and carry out a proof-of-principle validation. Taken together, these data provide a comprehensive, quantitative catalog of the genes that mediate olfactory perception and pheromone-evoked behavior at the periphery.},

abstract = {The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is an olfactory structure that detects pheromones and environmental cues. It consists of sensory neurons that express evolutionary unrelated groups of transmembrane chemoreceptors. The predominant V1R and V2R receptor repertoires are believed to detect airborne and water-soluble molecules, respectively. It has been suggested that the shift in habitat of early tetrapods from water to land is reflected by an increase in the ratio of V1R/V2R genes. Snakes, which have a very large VNO associated with a sophisticated tongue delivery system, are missing from this analysis. Here, we use RNA-seq and RNA in situ hybridization to study the diversity, evolution, and expression pattern of the corn snake vomeronasal receptor repertoires. Our analyses indicate that snakes and lizards retain an extremely limited number of V1R genes but exhibit a large number of V2R genes, including multiple lineages of reptile-specific and snake-specific expansions. We finally show that the peculiar bigenic pattern of V2R vomeronasal receptor gene transcription observed in mammals is conserved in squamate reptiles, hinting at an important but unknown functional role played by this expression strategy. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the shift to a vomeronasal receptor repertoire dominated by V1Rs in mammals reflects the evolutionary transition of early tetrapods from water to land. This study sheds light on the evolutionary dynamics of the vomeronasal receptor families in vertebrates and reveals how mammals and squamates differentially adapted the same ancestral vomeronasal repertoire to succeed in a terrestrial environment.},

abstract = {Pair bonds are the cornerstone of a monogamous relationship. When individuals of the same species engage in monogamy and promiscuity (i.e. alternative reproductive tactics) it can be difficult to determine which tactic confers greater fitness, as measures of fitness can be difficult to ascertain. However, in these circumstances, whether animals preferentially establish pair bonds can reveal decisions that presumably reflect the animals' assessment of how to best maximize reproductive success. In nature, the majority of prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, establishes pair bonds and engages in social monogamy while a minority of individuals remains single and presumably mates promiscuously. The existence of these two tactics raises the interesting question: do bonded male prairie voles choose to ‘settle' (for just one partner) or are they preferentially ‘settling down'? To determine which of these two tactics is preferred, we provided single male prairie voles simultaneous access to two sexually receptive females for 24 h and then subsequently tested males in ‘partner preference tests' with each female independently contrasted with a novel female. We aimed to determine whether males would form a pair bond with one, both or none of the original females. We found that males formed pair bonds with one of the two females. We also investigated male- and female-initiated aggression and found that during the bonding process males were more aggressive with females that they did not ultimately form a bond with. In the partner preference tests, males showed more aggression towards unfamiliar females than towards familiar females. Mismatches in male- and female-initiated aggression suggest that aggressive interactions may be perpetuated more by males than by females. Taken together, our results demonstrate that under conditions that are ideal for forgoing bonding and engaging in multiple matings, males choose to establish a pair bond, suggesting that selective pressures may have facilitated bonding by males.},

Most of our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the neurophysiology of memory, however, derives from one-trial learning paradigms that, while powerful, do not fully embody the gradual, representational, and statistical aspects of cumulative learning. The early olfactory system-particularly olfactory bulb-comprises a reasonably well-understood and experimentally accessible neuronal network with intrinsic plasticity that underlies both one-trial (adult aversive, neonatal) and cumulative (adult appetitive) odor learning. These olfactory circuits employ many of the same molecular and structural mechanisms of memory as, for example, hippocampal circuits following inhibitory avoidance conditioning, but the temporal sequences of post-conditioning molecular events are likely to differ owing to the need to incorporate new information from ongoing learning events into the evolving memory trace. Moreover, the shapes of acquired odor representations, and their gradual transformation over the course of cumulative learning, also can be directly measured, adding an additional representational dimension to the traditional metrics of memory strength and persistence. In this review, we describe some established molecular and structural mechanisms of memory with a focus on the timecourses of post-conditioning molecular processes. We describe the properties of odor learning intrinsic to the olfactory bulb and review the utility of the olfactory system of adult rodents as a memory system in which to study the cellular mechanisms of cumulative learning.},

abstract = {Richardson's ground squirrels are social animals that warn conspecifics of a predator's presence through the production of alarm vocalizations. Their ability to discriminate among individual alarm callers and to identify the location of those callers may allow receivers to track predator movement from acoustic information in multiple-caller bouts. Observations of encounters with live terrestrial and avian predators revealed that squirrels were significantly more likely to produce a multiple-caller bout that tracked predator movement when avian predators were airborne than when predators remained on the ground. To test whether receivers perceived such differences, squirrels were presented with playbacks of multiple-caller bouts composed of either chirps (commonly issued in response to airborne predators), or whistles (commonly issued in response to predators on the ground) from callers that were either unfamiliar or familiar to the receiver. In response to unfamiliar chirps, but not unfamiliar whistles, receivers were significantly more vigilant when call bouts progressively increased in proximity than when call bouts progressively decreased in proximity. Thus, Richardson's ground squirrels use multiple alarm callers to track airborne avian but not terrestrial predators, presumably owing to the more immediate threat that airborne predators pose, but also because of the relative paucity of directional information in bouts of whistle calls associated with potential threats on the ground. Squirrels were more responsive to calls from familiar neighbours, however, and despite our relatively small sample of familiar caller playbacks, receivers showed limited evidence of differential response to approaching versus receding bouts of whistle calls when they were familiar with callers.},

abstract = {Olfactory receptors (ORs) located in the cell membrane of olfactory sensory neurons of the nasal epithelium are responsible for odor detection by binding specific odorant ligands. Primates are thought to have a reduced sense of smell (microsmatic) with respect to other mammals such as dogs or rodents. We have previously demonstrated that over 70{\%} of the human OR genes have become nonfunctional pseudogenes, leading us to hypothesize that the reduced sense of smell could correlate with the loss of functional genes. To extend these results, we sampled the OR gene repertoire of 10 primate species, from prosimian lemur to human, in addition to mouse. About 221 previously unidentified primate sequences and 33 mouse sequences were analyzed. These sequences encode ORs distributed in seven families and 56 subfamilies. Analysis showed a high fraction ( approximately 50{\%} on average) of pseudogenes in hominoids. In contrast, only approximately 27{\%} of OR genes are pseudogenes in Old World monkeys, and New World monkeys are almost free of pseudogenes. The prosimian branch seems to have evolved differently from the other primates and has approximately 37{\%} pseudogene content. No pseudogenes were found in mouse. With the exception of New World monkeys, we demonstrate that primates have a high fraction of OR pseudogenes compared with mouse. We hypothesize that under relaxed selective constraints, primates would have progressively accumulated pseudogenes with the highest level seen in hominoids. The fraction of pseudogenes in the OR gene repertoire could parallel the evolution of the olfactory sensory function.},

Some signalers, with too low a threshold of excitation, will issue false alarms and should be ignored if potential alarm recipients are to maximize energy gains. We exposed juvenile Richardson's ground squirrels to reliable signalers, whose alarm calls were paired with the presentation of a predator model, and unreliable signalers, whose alarm calls were played when no potential predator was present. Call recipients discriminated among individual alarm callers, and reduced responsiveness to callers that had been unreliable. Thus, like primates, squirrels are capable of forming a concept of reliability by associating an individual's identity with that individual's past performance.},

abstract = {Evidence for long-term cooperative relationships comes from several social birds and mam- mals. Vampire bats demonstrate cooperative social bonds, and like primates, they maintain these bonds through social grooming. It is unclear, however, to what extent vampires are special among bats in this regard. We compared social grooming rates of common vampire bats Desmodus rotundus and four other group-living bats, Artibeus jamaicensis, Carollia perspicillata, Eidolon helvum and Rousettus aegyptiacus, under the same captive condi- tions of fixed association and no ectoparasites. We conducted 13 focal sampling sessions for each combination of sex and species, for a total of 1560 presence/absence observations per species.We observed evidence for social grooming in all species, but social grooming rates were on average 14 times higher in vampire bats than in other species. Self-grooming rates did not differ. Vampire bats spent 3.7{\%} of their awake time social grooming (95{\%} CI = 1.5–6.3{\%}), whereas bats of the other species spent 0.1–0.5{\%} of their awake time social grooming. Together with past data, this result supports the hypothesis that the elevated social grooming rate in the vampire bat is an adaptive trait, linked to their social bonding and unique regurgitated food sharing behavior.

There are relationships among social odours (chemical signals), parasite recognition and avoidance that are associated with hormonal, neural and genomic mechanisms in rodents. Rodents use social odours to: (i) distinguish between infected and uninfected individuals; (ii) recognize specific infected individuals; and (iii) avoid and display aversive responses to infected individuals. There are genomic correlates of this parasite recognition and avoidance in which genes expressing the neuropeptide oxytocin have roles.

Recognition, compared with perception of exactly the same sound, produced significantly less but well focused Fos-positive cells in a primary auditory cortical field and significantly more labeling in higher auditory and association fields. Thus, recognition means a state of distinctive spatial distribution of activity in auditory cortical fields with a predominance of activation in higher-order fields.},

abstract = {Vertebrate odorant receptors comprise three types of G protein-coupled receptors: the OR, V1R and V2R receptors. The OR superfamily contains over 1,000 genes in some mammalian species, representing the largest gene superfamily in the mammalian genome. To facilitate an informed analysis of OR gene phylogeny, we identified the complete set of 143 OR genes in the zebrafish genome, as well as the OR repertoires in two pufferfish species, fugu (44 genes) and tetraodon (42 genes). Although the genomes analyzed here contain fewer genes than in mammalian species, the teleost OR genes can be grouped into a larger number of major clades, representing greater overall OR diversity in the fish. Based on the phylogeny of fish and mammalian repertoires, we propose a model for OR gene evolution in which different ancestral OR genes or gene families were selectively lost or expanded in different vertebrate lineages. In addition, our calculations of the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous codon substitutions among more recently expanding OR subgroups in zebrafish implicate residues that may be involved in odorant binding.},

abstract = {Abstract. Although scent over-marking is a commonly observed behaviour among mammals, it has received little experimental attention. With regard to individual signatures, there are three types of information that might be obtained from such marks: (1) the scents might blend, thus creating a new odour quality but sacrificing individually distinctive information, (2) the scents might remain distinct, preserving individual identity information, or (3) the scent on top could mask the individual identity information in the bottom scent. These three possibilities were tested in golden hamsters for two scents (flank gland and vaginal secretions) that are deposited by hamsters using two distinct patterns of scent-marking behaviour. In an habituation paradigm, test animals were exposed on five successive trials to a simulated over-mark in which the scent from one individual was placed on top of scent from another individual. On the sixth (test) trial, males were exposed to two separate scents, one from a novel individual and the other from the individual that provided either the top or the bottom scent during the habituation trials. Results on the test trial were similar for both vaginal secretions (experiment 1) and flank gland scent (experiment 2). The novel scent was investigated more than the top scent, indicating that the top scent was familiar to the males, but the bottom scent and the novel scent were investigated equally, indicating that the bottom scent was not familiar. These results suggest that the distinctive information in the bottom scent was masked by that of the top scent; furthermore, they show that the other two possible phenomena (scents blending or remaining distinct) did not occur. This demonstration of scent masking may well be the first reported to date. The possible significance of over-marking in hamsters and other species is discussed, and it is suggested that the precision and thoroughness of covering one scent with another may relate to species differences in the information available in over-marks and therefore in the functions that such marks serve.},

Since its discovery in 1906 and synthesis in the early 1950s, elegant pharmacological work has helped identify specific neural substrates on which Oxt exerts its effects. More recently, mice with targeted genetic disruptions of the Oxt system—i.e., both the peptide and its receptor (the Oxtr)—have further defined Oxt's actions and laid some important scientific groundwork for studies in other species. In this article, we highlight the scientific contributions that various mouse knockouts of the Oxt system have made to our understanding of Oxt's modulation of behavior. We specifically focus on how the use of these mice has shed light on our understanding of social recognition memory, maternal behavior, aggression, and several nonsocial behaviors. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {The mouse olfactory mucosa is a complex chemosensory tissue composed of multiple cell types, neuronal and non-neuronal. We have here applied RNA-seq hierarchically, in three steps of decreasing cellular heterogeneity: starting with crude tissue samples dissected from the nose, proceeding to flow-cytometrically sorted pools of mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), and finally arriving at single mature OSNs. We show that 98.9{\%} of intact olfactory receptor (OR) genes are expressed in mature OSNs. We uncover a hitherto unknown bipartition among mature OSNs. We find that 19 of 21 single mature OSNs each express a single intact OR gene abundantly, consistent with the one neuron-one receptor rule. For the 9 single OSNs where the two alleles of the abundantly expressed OR gene exhibit single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we demonstrate that monoallelic expression of the abundantly expressed OR gene is extremely tight. The remaining two single mature OSNs lack OR gene expression but express Trpc2 and Gucy1b2. We establish these two cells as a neuronal cell type that is fundamentally distinct from canonical, OR-expressing OSNs and that is defined by the differential, higher expression of 55 genes. We propose this tiered experimental approach as a paradigm to unravel gene expression in other cellularly heterogeneous systems.},

abstract = {Androgenic hormones can rapidly influence how animals behave, although the dynamics of these effects remain elusive. In particular, we know little about whether androgens rapidly impact behavioural strategizing or whether such effects vary among individuals of the same species. Here, we examine these issues by testing how transient testosterone (T) surges, which normally occur in response to social stimuli, rapidly alter the urinary marking behaviour of socially subordinate and dominant male white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus. Marking behaviour in mice is important in reproductive competition and advertisement; thus, how an individual marks its environment with urine likely reflects the strategy it uses to find a mate. Moreover, urine-marking patterns are indicative of social status and territorial propensity. Our results show that a single T pulse, within minutes, suppresses all measures of urinary marking behaviour in subordinate mice, including amounts of perimeter (territorial) marking and total (status-related) marking. These effects are not observed in dominant mice. The data collectively suggest that androgens rapidly change behaviour tightly associated with reproductive strategy and decision making. Moreover, these effects depend on an individual's social status, which suggests that there is intraspecific variation in the way that androgens affect marking behaviour on short timescales. This study fills a gap in our understanding about the plasticity of rapid androgenic effects on behaviour, and how these responses can influence adaptive reproductive tactics.},

abstract = {In view of theoretical interest in the relationships between mating systems and dispersal patterns and the paucity of empirical data on dispersal in monogamous mammals, I studied natal dispersal in the monogamous rodent Perotnyscus californicus. Genealogical relationships were determined using fluorescent pigment transfer and DNA fingerprinting, and dispersal distances were determined using dispersal fences and intensive trapping. Minimum dispersal distances were greater for females than for males. Philopatric males (those settling within one home-range diameter of their birth site) tended to be from smaller litters than non-philopatric males. Minimum dispersal distances of males were positively associated with natal litter size at weaning, whereas minimum dispersal distances of females were positively associated with number of sisters in the natal litter. These results suggest that intrasexual mate competition drives female dispersal, while resource compe- tition drives male dispersal. Males remain closer to their natal range than females, most likely to acquire and defend resources to attract females. Peromj'scus californicus is unusual among mammals in displaying both a monogamous mating system and female-biased dispersal.},

Bilateral infusion of an adeno‐associated viral vector containing the prairie vole V1a receptor gene (V1aR‐AAV) regulated by a neuron‐specific enolase promoter resulted in a stable increase in V1a receptor binding density in the rat septum without affecting oxytocin receptor density. Control animals were infused with a vector expressing the lacZ gene. In a social discrimination paradigm, only V1aR‐AAV‐treated animals succeeded in discriminating a previously encountered from a novel juvenile after an interexposure interval (IEI) of more than 2 h, demonstrating the functional incorporation of the vole V1a receptor in the rat septal circuits underlying short‐term memory processes. Microdialysis administration of synthetic vasopressin during the first juvenile exposure, used to mimic intraseptal release patterns of the neuropeptide, produced similar prolongations in recognition (up to an IEI of 24 h) in both V1aR‐AAV and control animals. Septal microdialysis administration of a selective V1a, but not oxytocin, receptor antagonist in both groups prevented discrimination even after an IEI of as short as 0.5 h, confirming the specificity of the vole V1a receptor involvement in social discrimination abilities. In addition, active social interactions were found to be increased among V1aR‐AAV rats compared to controls. Viral vector‐mediated gene transfer provides a valuable tool for studies on the role of localized gene expression on behavioural parameters.},

abstract = {In laboratory studies using albino house mice, a female's prior intrauterine position can affect many postnatal physiological, morphological and behavioral characteristics. Females flanked by males in utero (2 M females) exhibit more aggressive dominance than females flanked by females (0 M females). Thus, wild 2 M females may be most successful during peak population densities when their aggressive nature would allow them to displace other females from limited resources. 2 M and 0 M females and males delivered by cesarean section were individually marked and released as young adults on two occasions onto a "highway island" (the area enclosed by exit and entrance ramps at an interchange) to determine whether 2 M females have a competitive advantage over 0 M females in the field. Males were included to create realistic population structure; their intrauterine position was not a treatment. Feeding stations afforded individuals an opportunity to exhibit their dominance by maintaining home-ranges at or near the stations. The populations were monitored by periodic live-trapping and reproductive success was determined using field body weights and by post-mortem examination for uterine implantation scars. Survival and capture rates were estimated, using a modified Jolly-Seber mark-recapture program, for each of four intervals between trapping occasions over the course of 7 weeks. There were no overall differences in survivorship between 2 M and 0 M females, neither type of female was caught more frequently at feeding stations and they did not differ in measures of reproductive success. However, 2 M females had significantly larger home-range sizes than 0 M females and thus space use may be a trait "masculinized" by prior intrauterine position. Although there are a number of life-history characteristics that differ between 0 M and 2 M females in the laboratory that we did not test specifically in the field, our findings and other features of wild house mouse biology suggest that prior intrauterine position does not have a strong effect on survival and reproduction in the wild.},

abstract = {The spacing patterns among a group of adult Spermophilus richardsonii were studied in 1975 and 1976. Major features of the social structure were as follows: relatively uniform dispersion of the Squirrels, overlap of ranges with overlap reaching a maximum after weaning of young and before hibernation, and dominance within the core area (defined as the area in which a squirrel concentrated 50{\%} of its aboveground time). Although there was greater proximity among kin than among nonkin, each adult maintained a separate core area. Adult males played no role in assisting females to rear young, and males were dominant to females only when within their own core areas. Throughout the active season the size of the core area remained relatively constant at about 225 m2 and the average distance between a squirrel and its nearest neighbor remained at about 20–25 m. The core area differed from the usual concept of a territory in that it was characterized by reduced submission rather than increased aggression by the resi...},

Southern blot using human OTR cDNA probes indicated that the mouse genome has a single copy of the gene. The predicted amino acid sequence is 91{\%} identical to human OTR. The gene contains 4 exons and 3 introns. Exons 1 and 2 contain the 5' untranslated region, with exons 3 and 4 encoding the amino acids of the receptor. Intron 3 interrupts the coding at the same location, after transmembrane domain 6, as in OTR genes of other species. The promoter region lacks an apparent TATA box but contains multiple putative interleukin-response elements and estrogen responsive elements. Expression of OTR gene in the uterus during pregnancy reached maximum at day 20 gestation. The information obtained from the mouse OTR gene facilitates further comparative and biochemical analysis for protein structure-function relationships and gene regulatory mechanisms.},

@article{Brennan2006,
abstract = {Mammalian social systems rely on signals passed between individuals conveying information including sex, reproductive status, individual identity, ownership, competitive ability and health status. Many of these signals take the form of complex mixtures of molecules sensed by chemosensory systems and have important influences on a variety of behaviours that are vital for reproductive success, such as parent-offspring attachment, mate choice and territorial marking. This article aims to review the nature of these chemosensory cues and the neural pathways mediating their physiological and behavioural effects. Despite the complexities of mammalian societies, there are instances where single molecules can act as classical pheromones attracting interest and approach behaviour. Chemosignals with relatively high volatility can be used to signal at a distance and are sensed by the main olfactory system. Most mammals also possess a vomeronasal system, which is specialized to detect relatively non-volatile chemosensory cues following direct contact. Single attractant molecules are sensed by highly specific receptors using a labelled line pathway. These act alongside more complex mixtures of signals that are required to signal individual identity. There are multiple sources of such individuality chemosignals, based on the highly polymorphic genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or lipocalins such as the mouse major urinary proteins. The individual profile of volatile components that make up an individual odour signature can be sensed by the main olfactory system, as the pattern of activity across an array of broadly tuned receptor types. In addition, the vomeronasal system can respond highly selectively to non-volatile peptide ligands associated with the MHC, acting at the V2r class of vomeronasal receptor. The ability to recognize individuals or their genetic relatedness plays an important role in mammalian social behaviour. Thus robust systems for olfactory learning and recognition of chemosensory individuality have evolved, often associated with major life events, such as mating, parturition or neonatal development. These forms of learning share common features, such as increased noradrenaline evoked by somatosensory stimulation, which results in neural changes at the level of the olfactory bulb. In the main olfactory bulb, these changes are likely to refine the pattern of activity in response to the learned odour, enhancing its discrimination from those of similar odours. In the accessory olfactory bulb, memory formation is hypothesized to involve a selective inhibition, which disrupts the transmission of the learned chemosignal from the mating male. Information from the main olfactory and vomeronasal systems is integrated at the level of the corticomedial amygdala, which forms the most important pathway by which social odours mediate their behavioural and physiological effects. Recent evidence suggests that this region may also play an important role in the learning and recognition of social chemosignals.},

The authors report that AVP in the lateral septum is important for pair bond formation. Administration of an AVP receptor antagonist in the lateral septum blocked mating-induced pair bonding, whereas administration of AVP induced this behavior in the absence of mating. In addition, administration of an oxytocin (OT) receptor antagonist in the lateral septum also blocked pair bond formation induced by either mating or AVP administration, suggesting that the OT receptor blockade may have interfered with the AVP regulation of behavior. Together, these data provide evidence suggesting that AVP in the lateral septum regulates pair bond formation in male prairie voles and that this process requires access to both AVP and OT receptors},

@incollection{Francia2014,
abstract = {In most species, there are two chemosensory systems, both located in the nasal cavity but physiologically and anatomically distinct (Figure 10.1). The main olfactory epithelium (MOE) is principally involved in the airborne odor perception, whereas the vomeronasal organ (VNO) of Jacobson in the detection of pheromones that are chemical compounds secreted or excreted by individuals of the same species (conspecifics) (Dulac {\&} Torello 2003; Tirindelli et al. 2009). Deficits in social and reproductive behavior are marked in animals underlying the surgical removal of the VNO but also the chemical inactivation of the MOE (Kiyokawa et al. 2007; Kolunie {\&} Stern 1995; Leypold et al. 2002; Wysocki {\&} Lepri 1991). Furthermore, there is evidence that two olfactory structures, namely the septal organ of Masera and the Grueneberg ganglion also contribute to pheromone detection (Ma 2007; Roppolo et al. 2006; Tirindelli et al. 2009) (Figure 10.1). Primary sensory VNO neurons (VSNs) send axons to mitral cells in the glomerular region of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), whereas olfactory neurons (OSNs) to the mitral cells of the main olfactory bulb (MOB) (Baum {\&} Kelliher 2009; Clapham {\&} Neer 1997) (Figure 10.1). The chemosensory neurons of the VNO and MOE are equipped with specific receptors that activate distinct molecular cascades and mediate sociosexual behaviors (Del Punta et al. 2002; Stowers et al. 2002). The anatomical components of the VNO firstly developed in a tetrapod ancestor and led to the appearance of a rudimentary structure in amphibians that became highly organized in Squamata and in many mammalian orders as Didelphimorphia, Rodentia, and in primates (prosimians and New World monkeys). In contrast, VNO is virtually absent in birds, bats, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans (Dennis et al. 2004; Grus et al. 2005; Shi {\&} Zhang 2007; Smith et al. 2005; Zhao et al. 2011) (Figure 10.2a). In Didelphimorphia, Lagomorpha, and Rodentia, the VNO chemosensory epithelium presents two separate neuronal layers (apical and basal) characterized by the expression of different G protein subunits and receptors (Young {\&} Trask 2007). Apical and basal neurons project to two distinct regions (anterior and posterior) of the AOB. From the AOB, the majority of the centripetal projections of the apical and basal neurons remain segregated in the amygdala and hypothalamus (Martinez-Marcos 2009; Yoon et al. 2005). In other mammalian orders (Carnivora) the dichotomic organization of the vomeronasal projections is not well defined or even absent (Artiodactyla) (Dennis et al. 2003).},

abstract = {The neuropeptide oxytocin has been implicated in the mediation of several forms of affiliative behavior including parental care, grooming, and sex behavior. Here we demonstrate that species from the genus Microtus (voles) selected for differences in social affiliation show contrasting patterns of oxytocin receptor expression in brain. By in vitro receptor autoradiography with an iodinated oxytocin analogue, specific binding to brain oxytocin receptors was observed in both the monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) and the polygamous montane vole (Microtus montanus). In the prairie vole, oxytocin receptor density was highest in the prelimbic cortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, midline nuclei of the thalamus, and the lateral aspects of the amygdala. These brain areas showed little binding in the montane vole, in which oxytocin receptors were localized to the lateral septum, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and cortical nucleus of the amygdala. Similar differences in brain oxytocin receptor distribution were observed in two additional species, the monogamous pine vole (Microtus pinetorum) and the polygamous meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus). Receptor distributions for two other neurotransmitter systems implicated in the mediation of social behavior, benzodiazepines, and mu opioids did not show comparable species differences. Furthermore, in the montane vole, which shows little affiliative behavior except during the postpartum period, brain oxytocin receptor distribution changed within 24 hr of parturition, concurrent with the onset of maternal behavior. We suggest that variable expression of the oxytocin receptor in brain may be an important mechanism in evolution of species-typical differences in social bonding and affiliative behavior.},

The field study was carried out in four 0.25-ha enclosures (two control and two experimental), each situated on natural pasture. This study had two periods: 1) Absence of fathers (AF) (from September 2003 to January 2004), and 2) Absence of mothers (AM) (from October 2004 to February 2005). In both periods, in control enclosures both parents remained with the offspring. During AF period, in experimental enclosures only the mothers remained with their offspring. In AM period, only the adult males remained with their offspring in experimental enclosures. Three trapping sessions of 8 successive nights every fortnight were carried out. Sexual maturation and reproductive activity of spring-born females were compared between treatments using repeatedmeasures ANOVA. The repeated measures factor was the age of young females. In both periods the number of spring-born females in each reproductive condition was independent of treatments. The females matured according to their physiological times (30-40 days of age). The removal of fathers and mothers did not affect either the timing of sexual maturation or the reproduction of C. musculinus spring-born females. Future research to test the effect of adult female density on juveniles should be done to test the same parameters},

abstract = {To explore whether selection for testosterone-mediated traits in males might be constrained by costs of higher testosterone to females, we examined the effects of experimental elevation of plasma testosterone on physiological, reproductive, and behavioral parameters in a female songbird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). We used subcutaneous implants to elevate testosterone (T) in captive and free-living female juncos. In captive birds, we measured the effects of high T on body mass, feather molt, and brood patch formation. In the field, we monitored its effects on the timing of egg laying, clutch size, egg size, egg steroid levels, incubation, and nest-defense behavior. Females implanted with testosterone (T-females) had significantly higher circulating levels of testosterone than did control females (C-females). Captive T-females had lower body mass, were less likely to develop brood patches, and delayed feather molt relative to C-females. Among free-living females, the interval between nest completion and appearance of the first egg was longer for T-females than for C-females and egg yolk concentrations of testosterone were higher, but there were no significant differences in estradiol levels, clutch size, or egg size. Incubation and nest defense behavior were also similar between T- and C-females. Our results suggest that selection on males for higher testosterone might initially lead to a correlated response in females producing changes in body mass and feather molt, both of which could be detrimental. Other possible female responses would be delayed onset of reproduction, which might reduce reproductive success, and higher yolk testosterone, which might have either positive or negative effects on offspring development. We found no reason to expect reduced parental behavior by females as a negative fitness consequence of selection for higher testosterone in males.},

abstract = {In the case of some mammalian species, females with larger anogenital distance (AGD) have smaller litters, where the sex ratio is male-biased. The first aim of the present study was to test whether this phenomenon exists in the Lagomorph group, especially in rabbits. The results revealed that does with large AGD have significantly smaller and lighter litters with a male biased sex ratio; with fewer females but not more males. The second aim of the present study was to test whether males differentiate between females differing in their AGD and are thus capable of choosing the more fertile and fecund does. Males showed a stronger response to the chin marks of females with small AGD than to the marks of females with large AGD. Our results suggest that variation in the prenatal hormonal environment, reflected through variation in AGD, could have long-term consequences on mate choice and population dynamics. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The functional significance of communal nesting and nursing is poorly understood. Female house mice often communally nest, and within these communal nests females appear to indiscriminately nurse all pups, a rare trait for any mammal. In this study, the hypothesis that communal nesting provides protection from conspecific infanticide was tested and supported in semi-natural populations of house mice. Conspecific infanticide in single-mother nests (69{\%}, N = 412) was twice that in communal nests (33{\%}, N = 508). Because this major benefit of communal nesting does not require communal nursing, direct benefits to communal nursing itself were tested. Most proposed benefits should result in heavier weaning weights, but no differences were found between communal and single nests in the semi-natural populations. If communal nursing is to be avoided in communal nests, dams must recognize their own pups. Retrieval tests conducted in the laboratory produced equivocal results. Dams discriminated between pups that differed in age, but not between their own and other age-matched pups. The major survival advantage of communal nesting, coupled with the failure to find nutritional advantages for communally nursed pups, supports a recent suggestion that communal nursing is an unavoidable consequence of communal nesting. This hypothesis is further strengthened by data indicating that communal nesting partners tend to be kin, thereby providing inclusive fitness benefits to communal nursing. Although costs of communal nursing were proposed and tested, no such costs were found. We also show from 15 observations of infanticide that all classes of adults (territorial and non-territorial males, pregnant and non-pregnant females) are infanticidal. These observations are in conflict with previous laboratory studies.},

abstract = {Many mammals use scent marks to advertise territory ownership, but only recently have we started to understand the complexity of these scent signals and the types of information that they convey. Whilst attention has generally focused on volatile odorants as the main information molecules in scents, studies of the house mouse have now defined a role for a family of proteins termed major urinary proteins (MUPs) which are, of course, involatile. MUPs bind male signalling volatiles and control their release from scent marks. These proteins are also highly polymorphic and the pattern of polymorphic variants provides a stable ownership signal that communicates genome-derived information on the individual identity of the scent owner. Here we review the interaction between the chemical basis of mouse scents and the dynamics of their competitive scent marking behaviour, demonstrating how it is possible to provide reliable signals of the competitive ability and identity of individual males.},

abstract = {The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission in the control of convulsive epileptic seizures is considered from the perspective of the actions of drugs that augment GABA transmission in the brain. In particular, the effects of a directly acting GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol, is compared with the effects of a GABA-elevating agent, gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG, vigabatrin), in animal models of convulsive seizures. Evidence indicates that there are certain regions of the brain where enhanced GABA transmission is anticonvulsant; in other regions, blockade of GABA transmission exerts anticonvulsant actions. In addition, there are brain areas in which the effects of muscimol and GVG are distinct from one another, owing to a relatively low level of endogenous GABA transmission in those areas. The direct stimulation of postsynaptic GABA receptors (by direct receptor agonists) bypasses normal mechanisms of synaptic transmission and can evoke abnormal neurological symptoms, whereas the enhancement of presynaptic availability of GABA avoids these complications. GVG acts to boost presynaptic GABA stores, which can then be utilized physiologically; this may account for the relatively low incidence of CNS-related side effects with anticonvulsant doses of GVG. It is suggested that greater attention be focused on ways of enhancing endogenous GABA availability in future drug development for the control of seizure disorders.},

Yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, ground-dwelling sciurid rodents, produce individually distinctive alarm calls. Using an habituation–recovery playback protocol, we show that marmots can perceive differences between the calls of different adult females. We further show that marmots are able to discriminate between at least one broad age–sex category. In contrast to what has been reported in other species, playback of calls from juveniles elicited a greater response (i.e. marmots increased vigilance and suppressed foraging) than did playback of calls from adult females. No other age–sex category led to responses significantly different from adult females. Future studies will seek to understand why individual discriminative abilities exist, but we have shown that individuals are able to identify when young, and presumably vulnerable, marmots are calling, and to respond by engaging in vigilance.},

Using receptor autoradiography, the authors examined whether AVP and OT receptor patterns were associated with facultative paternal behavior in either sexually and parentally inexperienced or experienced meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus). Experienced, in contrast to inexperienced, males had less AVP binding in the lateral septum (LS), more AVP binding in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), and more OT binding in the AON, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, LS, and lateral amygdala. Thus, specific AVP receptor patterns, which co-occur with paternal care in consistently paternal voles, also may be associated with paternal care (when present) in typically nonpaternal species. This study also demonstrated a possible relationship between OT receptor patterns and paternal state in male mammals.},

abstract = {Social recognition constitutes the basis of social life. In male mice and rats, social recognition is known to be governed by the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) through its action on OT receptors (OTRs) in the medial amygdala. In female rats and mice, which have sociosexual behaviors controlling substantial investment in reproduction, an important role for OT in sociosexual behaviors has also been shown. However, the site in the female brain for OT action on social recognition is still unknown. Here we used a customized, controlled release system of biodegradable polymeric microparticles to deliver, in the medial amygdala of female mice, "locked nucleic acid" antisense (AS) oligonucleotides with sequences specific for the mRNA of the OTR gene. We found that single bilateral intraamygdala injections of OTR AS locked nucleic acid oligonucleotides several days before behavioral testing reduced social recognition. Thus, we showed that gene expression for OTR specifically in the amygdala is required for normal social recognition in female mice. Importantly, during the same experiment, we performed a detailed ethological analysis of mouse behavior revealing that OTR AS-treated mice underwent an initial increase in ambivalent risk-assessment behavior. Other behaviors were not affected, thus revealing specific roles for amygdala OTR in female social recognition potentially mediated by anxiety in a social context. Understanding the functional genomics of OT and OTR in social recognition should help elucidate the neurobiological bases of human disorders of social behavior (e.g., autism).},

Social species have evolved various behavioral strategies reducing the probability of pathogen exposure [2]. In rodents, sick conspecific avoidance can be induced by olfactory cues emitted by parasitized or infected conspecifics [3-6]. The neural circuits involved in this behavior remain largely unknown. We observed that olfactory cues present in bodily products of mice in an acute inflammatory state or infected with a viral pathogen are aversive to conspecifics. We found that these chemical signals trigger neural activity in the vomeronasal system, an olfactory subsystem controlling various innate behaviors [7]. Supporting the functional relevance of these observations, we show that preference toward healthy individuals is abolished in mice with impaired vomeronasal function. These findings reveal a novel function played by the vomeronasal system.},

abstract = {Despite its well-described role in female affiliation, the influence of oxytocin on male pairbonding is largely unknown. However, recent human studies indicate that this nonapeptide has a potent influence on male behaviors commonly associated with monogamy. Here we investigated the distribution of oxytocin receptors (OTR) throughout the forebrain of the socially monogamous male prairie vole (. Microtus ochrogaster). Because males vary in both sexual and spatial fidelity, we explored the extent to which OTR predicted monogamous or non-monogamous patterns of space use, mating success and sexual fidelity in free-living males. We found that monogamous males expressed higher OTR density in the nucleus accumbens than non-monogamous males, a result that mirrors species differences in voles with different mating systems. OTR density in the posterior portion of the insula predicted mating success. Finally, OTR in the hippocampus and septohippocampal nucleus, which are nuclei associated with spatial memory, predicted patterns of space use and reproductive success within mating tactics. Our data highlight the importance of oxytocin receptor in neural structures associated with pairbonding and socio-spatial memory in male mating tactics. The role of memory in mating systems is often neglected, despite the fact that mating tactics impose an inherently spatial challenge for animals. Identifying mechanisms responsible for relating information about the social world with mechanisms mediating pairbonding and mating tactics is crucial to fully appreciate the suite of factors driving mating systems.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and Social Behavior. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Across all sensory modalities, stimuli can vary along multiple dimensions. Efficient extraction of information requires sensitivity to those stimulus dimensions that provide behaviorally relevant information. To derive social information from chemosensory cues, sensory systems must embed information about the relationships between behaviorally relevant traits of individuals and the distributions of the chemical cues that are informative about these traits. In simple cases, the mere presence of one particular compound is sufficient to guide appropriate behavior. However, more generally, chemosensory information is conveyed via relative levels of multiple chemical cues, in non-trivial ways. The computations and networks needed to derive information from multi-molecule stimuli are distinct from those required by single molecule cues. Our current knowledge about how socially relevant information is encoded by chemical blends, and how it is extracted by chemosensory systems is very limited. This manuscript explores several scenarios and the neuronal computations required to identify them.},

We exposed free-living adult RGS to playbacks of alarm calls differing in rate and length to determine whether adult receivers respond to the same alarm parameters as juveniles. Adult squirrels did not respond differentially to differences in call rate or length, suggesting that adult RGS do not attend to call rate as do juveniles. This difference in response may be attributable to a developmental change in the perceptual mechanisms by which individuals extract information regarding response urgency, but could also be a product of adult receivers devaluing information encoded in alarm calls emitted by relatively inexperienced juvenile signalers. },

abstract = {Scent-marking is a ubiquitous form of olfactory signaling in male mammals and both territorial males in resource-defense mating systems and dominant males in dominance mating systems scent-mark. A large body of evidence suggests a link between scent-marking by male mammals and intrasexual competition. Resource holders appear to mark to help establish and maintain their status. They may do this because scent marks allow potential opponents to assess the status or RHP of the signaler. Nonresource holding competitors benefit because they can adjust the level of escalation in relation to potential costs and benefits and avoid risky contests. Resource holders benefit through reduced costs because many nonresource holders withdraw to avoid escalated contests. Three basic mechanisms allow receivers to make decisions after detecting scent marks. Receivers may (1) detect intrinsic properties of scent marks (e.g., concentrations of androgen-dependent volatiles), (2) remember past contests and the odor of each individual involved and associate these with the odor of scent marks, and (3) remember the smell of marks recently encountered and match this smell with potential opponents that they meet subsequently. It is now known that all of these mechanisms are used, sometimes within one species (e.g., mice) and we argue that the mechanisms are used conditionally, depending on information available and potential costs and benefits to receivers. Game theoretical analysis has recently shown how territorial intruders may switch from using intrinsic properties of marks to scent-matching when making decision about whether to remain in a territory. Scent-marking may be a uniquely cheat-proof signal of status because males must be able to defend their territory or dominance status over the time taken to mark it. A pattern of marks is thus a signal of status that has been tested in intrasexual competition. It also seems likely that marks are intrinsically costly both in energetic terms and by increasing predation risk. Mice can detect whether urine is from a parasitized or nonparasitized individual and these odors could potentially signal immunocompetence if mediated by variation at the MHC region of the genome. This remains to be tested. It is known that mice can detect relatedness via urine volatiles mediated by the MHC and it has been predicted that males should modify their competitive behavior in the light of this information. Again this remains to be tested. Information about disease status and genetic relatedness does not explain why males maintain patterns of scent marks. Most, perhaps all, territories are scent-marked. This may be because most intruders are of lower RHP than resource holders and these males should usually withdraw after assessing the resource holder by its scent marks. The costs of defending a territory may thus be substantially reduced. The obligate link between scent-marking and territoriality suggests that resource-defense polygyny in mammals may not be economically viable without this reduction in the costs of area defense. A little information is available to show that females use information from patterns of scent marks and a great deal of information shows that they use intrinsic information. It is not known whether males signal to females to enable mate choice or if females eavesdrop on signals sent between male competitors. Most known responses are to male urine by female rodents. For example, females show physiological (priming) responses to male odors (e.g., advancing and synchronizing estrus, inducing abortion). Other research has identified factors responsible for female mate preferences in choice tests. For example, the dominance status of the signaling male is a predictor of female interest and such studies have identified androgen-dependent volatiles responsible for the response. More recently, females have been shown to use odor mediated by the MHC locus to choose mates in relation to their genetic relatedness and to use odor to distinguish healthy and diseased mates. Most of these studies have been on mice and most use male urine, but the effect of patterns of urine scent marks has not been investigated. The only studies that explicitly use scent marks are those showing that females match the odor of potential mates with marks previously found in the environment to select mates. Future research should aim to clarify how information about the quality of potential mates is transmitted and how females trade-off such information against genetic relatedness.},

abstract = {Evidence exists for the localization of the newly identified estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) within the rat paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON), regions which lack ERalpha. Presently, we investigate whether ERbeta-like-immunoreactivity (-ir) is found within cells of several major neuropeptide systems of these regions. Young adult Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized (OVX), and 1 week later half of the animals received estradiol-17beta (E). Dual-label immunocytochemistry was performed on adjacent sections by using an ERbeta antibody, followed by an antibody to either oxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), or corticotropin releasing hormone. Nuclear ERbeta-ir was identified within SON and retrochiasmatic SON, and in specific PVN subnuclei: medial parvicellular part, ventral and dorsal zones, dorsal and lateral parvicellular parts, and in the posterior magnocellular part, medial and lateral zones. However, the ERbeta-ir within magnocellular areas was noticeably less intense. OT-/ERbeta-ir colocalization was confirmed in neurons of the parvicellular subnuclei, in both OVX and OVX+E brains ( approximately 50{\%} of OT and 25{\%} of ERbeta-labeled cells between bregma -1.78 and -2.00). In contrast, few PVN parvicellular neurons contained both AVP- and ERbeta-ir. As well, very little overlap was observed in the distribution of cells containing corticotropin releasing hormone- or ERbeta-ir. In the SON, most nuclear ERbeta-ir colocalized with AVP-ir, whereas few OT-/ERbeta-ir dual-labeled cells were observed. These findings suggest that estrogen can directly modulate specific OT and AVP systems through an ERbeta-mediated mechanism, in a tissue-specific manner.},

This dose of OXT was ineffective when infused icv or into the ventromedial hypothalamus, mesencephalic central gray, or ventral tegmental area. A 500-ng dose of OXT significantly elevated lordosis responding when infused icv, corresponding with our previous findings. Mounting by males significantly increased immunoreactive levels of OXT and decreased the number of OXT immunostaining cells in the MPOA of sexually receptive rats pretreated with estrogen and progesterone. The MPOA is a primary site of the OXT facilitation of sexual receptivity where OXT may be released during mating.},

abstract = {Identifying reproductively viable partners may be the most important aspect of searching for a mate. When females vary in their reproductive receptivity, it is incumbent upon males to discriminate among females based on the likelihood of successful copulation and fertilization. We have observed that female African giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei) demonstrate profoundly delayed sexual development, with some adults exhibiting a highly neotenous, fully fused vagina. To say that the lack of vaginal patency presents a barrier to mating is a tremendous understatement. Based on this unique observation, we tested male preferences towards urine collected from patent and nonpatent females. We found that males with longer anogenital distances (AGD; a proximate measure of developmental masculinization) show differential interest towards patent and nonpatent females, preferring patent females. Strikingly, males with short AGDs did not show any differential interest between female odours. Correspondingly, only patent females demonstrated reduced interest in odour from short AGD males; nonpatent females did not demonstrate a preference. Our study demonstrates that pouched rats show differential interest in odours closely associated with mate quality. We are the first, to our knowledge, to show that the AGD of the evaluator enhances mate preferences and influences their interest in potential mating partners.},

abstract = {In golden hamsters, offensive aggression is facilitated by vasopressin and inhibited by serotonin. We tested whether these neurotransmitter systems respond to modifications resulting from the stress of threat and attack (i.e., social subjugation) during puberty. Male golden hamsters were weaned at postnatal day 25 (P25), exposed daily to aggressive adults from P28 to P42, and tested for offensive aggression as young adults (P45). The results showed a context-dependent alteration in aggressive behavior. Subjugated animals were more likely to attack younger and weaker intruders than nonsubjugated controls. Conversely, subjugated animals were less likely to attack animals of similar size and age. After testing, the animals were killed, and their brains were collected to determine whether these behavioral changes are underlined by changes in the vasopressin and serotonin systems. Social subjugation resulted in a 50{\%} decrease in vasopressin levels within the anterior hypothalamus, a site involved in the regulation of aggression. Furthermore, whereas the density of vasopressin-immunoreactive fibers within the area was not significantly altered in subjugated animals, the number of serotonin-immunoreactive varicosities within the anterior hypothalamus and lateral septum was 20{\%} higher in subjugated animals than in their controls. These results establish puberty as a developmental period sensitive to environmental stressors. Furthermore, the results show that changes in the vasopressin and serotonin systems can correlate with behavioral alterations, supporting the role of these two neurotransmitters in the regulation of aggression.},

abstract = {Scent marking on top of (overmarking), or in the vicinity of, a scent mark already present is commonly termed countermarking. Scent marks and countermarks provide a continuous record of competitive challenges between conspecifics, thus providing a reliable advertisement of an individual's ability to dominate or defend an area to other competitors and potential mates. To test the hypothesis that females should prefer males that countermark competing scent marks in their territory over those whose own marks are partially countermarked by a competing male, we manipulated scent marks in the territories of neighbouring male house mice (captive-bred Mus domesticus). As predicted, oestrous females were more strongly attracted to approach territory owners that countermarked the scent mark challenges of competitors than those that had been countermarked, and females themselves deposited more scent marks near the scents of these males. To investigate whether female mice use scent age, overlap or intrinsic qualitative or quantitative differences between scent marks and countermarks to make this discrimination, we redeposited male scent marks artificially as marks and partially overlapping countermarks, with or without a 24-h age difference between them. While the intrinsic quality or quantity of countermarks did not affect discrimination, an age difference between the original mark and subsequent countermark was important for consistent discrimination. The ultimate function of such competitive scent signalling thus may be to provide potential mates with a reliable indicator of the competitive ability of individuals advertising their high status. Since scent marks remain in the environment and are continuously available to challenge and investigation, they may provide a particularly effective and reliable means of dominance advertisement.

abstract = {The oxytocinergic system promotes social behavior and reduces anxiety. The significant roles and functional interactions of the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala in the regulation of fear provide a unique experimental setting to examine the effects of oxytocin on extinction of fear. In this study we manipulated the oxytocin system at different time points in either the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (IL-mPFC), the basolateral amygadala (BLA) or in the central amygdala (CeA). Manipulations of the oxytocin following retrieval of fear in the IL-mPFC resulted in facilitation of subsequent extinction. In contrast, in the BLA, manipulating the oxytocinergic system after the retrieval of fear was associated with contrasting effects; whereas the microinjection of exogenous synthetic oxytocin was associated with impaired extinction, the microinfusion of WAY-267474 facilitated extinction. In contrast, intra-BLA microinfusion of the selective agonist TGOT did not affect freezing. Oxytocin manipulations in the CeA had no effect on subsequent extinction. Contrasting effects were also found when the drugs were injected before conditioning. Whereas oxytocin manipulations in the BLA enhanced fear and impaired extinction, in the CeA the microinfusion of the selective agonists (WAY-267474 and TGOT), but not synthetic oxytocin, resulted in reduced freezing levels. These results show that in the rat, the oxytocinergic system differentially regulated fear and extinction in region and temporal-dependent manners and further join data to show that contrary to the prevailing belief that oxytocin is solely involved in reducing fear, oxytocin can also act as an enhancer of fear responses.},

abstract = {Genetic variation in Avpr1a, the locus encoding the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (V1aR), has been implicated in pair-bonding behavior in voles (genus Microtus) and humans, raising the possibility that this gene may contribute commonly to mating-system variation in mammals. In voles, differential expression of V1aR in the brain is associated with male partner-preference behavior in a comparison of a monogamous (Microtus ochrogaster) and promiscuous (Microtus montanus) species. This expression difference is correlated, in turn, with a difference in length of a 5' regulatory microsatellite in Avpr1a. Here, we use a combination of comparative sequencing of coding and regulatory regions, analysis of neural expression patterns, and signaling assays to test for differences in V1aR expression and function among eight species of deer mice (genus Peromyscus). Despite well-documented variation in Peromyscus social behavior, we find no association between mating system and length variation in the microsatellite locus linked to V1aR expression in voles. Further, there are no consistent differences in V1aR expression pattern between monogamous and promiscuous species in regions of the brain known to influence mating behavior. We do find statistical evidence for positive selection on the V1aR coding sequence including several derived amino acid substitutions in a monogamous Peromyscus lineage, yet these substitutions have no measurable effect on V1aR signaling activity. Together, these results suggest that mating-system variation in rodents is mediated by multiple genetic mechanisms.},

We find that the cortex in differently colored barbules, which contains a 2D photonic-crystal structure, is responsible for coloration. Simulations reveal that the photonic-crystal structure possesses a partial photonic bandgap along the direction normal to the cortex surface, for frequencies within which light is strongly reflected. Coloration strategies in peacock feathers are very ingenious and simple: controlling the lattice constant and the number of periods in the photonic-crystal structure. Varying the lattice constant produces diversified colors. The reduction of the number of periods brings additional colors, causing mixed coloration.},

abstract = {Both male and female peafowl grow crests on top of their head - iridescent blue in males, dull iridescent green and brown in females - but the potential signal function of this plumage ornament is unknown. In this study, peafowl crests were measured in three feral populations, and morphological variation in this ornament was studied in relation to body condition (body mass in relation to tarsus length) and health (white blood cell concentration and ectoparasite load). Prior to the start of the breeding season, male crests are wider with greater pennaceous area, and are more likely to have all feathers grown out compared with female crests. Only crest length changed with measurement date, increasing over time; in males, crest measurements were not related to the extent of train feather development. Crest morphology is a potential signal of individual health and condition in both sexes, but in different ways. In females, the amount of crest plumage grown out to its full extent was related to body condition at the start of the breeding season, whereas in males, the size and pennaceous area of the ornament were related to ectoparasite load. Observations of within-sex agonistic behaviour suggest a possible role for the crest ornament in status signaling in males, because males that engage in more aggressive interactions tend to have wider crests. There was no evidence for a relation between crest morphology and agonistic behaviour in females.},

abstract = {Many animals are known to preferentially mate with partners that are dissimilar at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in order to maximize the antigen binding repertoire (or disease resistance) in their offspring. Although several mammals, fish or lizards use odour cues to assessMHCsimilarity with potential partners, the ability of birds to assessMHC similarity using olfactory cues has not yet been explored. Here we used a behavioural binary choice test and high-throughput-sequencing of MHC class IIB to determine whether blue petrels can discriminate MHC similarity based on odour cues alone. Blue petrels are seabirds with particularly good sense of smell, they have a reciprocal mate choice and are known to preferentially mate withMHC-dissimilar partners. Incubating males preferentially approached the odour of the more MHC-dissimilar female, whereas incubating females showed opposite preferences. Given their mating pattern, females were, however, expected to show preference for the odour of the more MHC-dissimilar male. Further studies are needed to determine whether, as in women and female mice, the preference varies with the reproductive cycle in blue petrel females. Our results provide the first evidence that birds can use odour cues only to assess MHC dissimilarity},

abstract = {Most recent models of the partitioning of reproduction attempt to explain patterns of skew on the assumption that dominant individuals have complete control over breeding opportunities within the group, but may nevertheless concede a share of direct reproduction to subordinates as an incentive to remain peacefully in the association. Although these models may be applicable to some animal societies, we argue that they fail to provide a comprehensive theory of skew. Instead, we suggest that subordinates may often be able to claim unsanctioned reproduction for themselves, but will be forced to excercise a degree of reproductive restraint lest they incite ejection by the dominant. Reproductive skew, in other words, may reflect the threat of ejection (inducing subordinate restraint) rather that the threat of subordinate departure (inducing reproductive concessions by dominants). We present a simple evolutionarily stable strategy model of reproductive skew under these circumstances, which demonstrates that a shift in emphasis from reproductive concession by dominants to reproductive restraint on the part of subordinates, radically alters the predictions of skew models. High group productivity, high relatedness and (when group members are related) strong ecological constraints are all expected to lead to reduced skew (the opposite conclusions to those of previous, concession-based analyses). The reason is that these factors reduce the benefits (or increase the costs) of ejection to the dominant, who therefore does best to tolerate more subordinate reproduction.},

abstract = {Arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been implicated in a wide variety of social behaviors ranging from affiliation to aggression. However, the precise functional involvement of AVP in intermale aggression is still a matter of debate. In fact, very little is known about AVP release patterns within distinct brain regions during the display of intermale aggression and, in turn, the behavioral consequences of such release. We used intracerebral microdialysis to monitor local AVP release within the lateral septum (LS) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) of adult male Wistar rats during the resident-intruder (RI) test. Resident males were cohabitated with a female prior to the RI test to stimulate intermale aggression toward the intruder male. AVP release within the LS correlated positively with intermale aggression. The specific AVP V1a receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (10??g/ml) administered via retrodialysis (3.3??l/min, 30min) into the LS of high-aggressive rats prior to the second RI test, prevented an increase in aggression in the second compared with the first RI test as seen in vehicle-treated high-aggressive rats. In contrast to the LS, AVP release within the BST correlated negatively with intermale aggression. Moreover, retrodialysis of synthetic AVP (1??g/ml) administered into the BST of high-aggressive rats significantly reduced the display of aggression during the second RI test. These data reveal that AVP can both promote and inhibit intermale aggression, depending upon the brain region in which AVP is released. Although challenging the general view that central AVP release enhances intermale aggression in rodents, our data support a model in which AVP coordinates a range of social behaviors by eliciting region-specific effects. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract Arginine vasopressin modulates pairbond formation in the monogamous prairie vole ( Microtus ochrogaster). Our laboratory has investigated the genetic and neural mechanisms by which vasopressin and its V1a receptor (V1aR) regulate social attachment between mates. Non-monogamous vole species show strikingly different distribution patterns of brain V1aR expression compared to monogamous species, and these patterns are thought to arise from species differences in the respective promoter sequences of the V1aR gene. Individual differences in prairie vole V1aR patterns may also reflect individual differences in promoter sequences. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of the specific brain regions that express V1aR in the ‘monogamous pattern' allows multilevel examination of the neural circuits that underlie pairbond formation in monogamous species. For example, V1aR are expressed in brain regions involved in reward circuitry in monogamous vole species and have been implicated in pairbonding. V1aR are also highly expressed in regions implicated in the olfactory processing of sociosexual behaviour. We hypothesize that both circuits of reward and olfactory memory underlie the cognitive mechanisms that control pairbonding. When used in conjuction, genetic and cellular analyses of a complex social behaviour can provide a coherent framework with which to examine the role of the vasopressin system in species evolution and neural control of behaviour.},

The amount of flank marking stimulated by microinjection of AVP (9 $\mu$M in 200 nl saline) into the MPOA-AH varied significantly over the 4 days of the estrous cycle with the lowest levels of flank marking observed on estrus. A second experiment demonstrated that administration of progesterone significantly reduced AVP-stimulated flank marking in estradiol-treated ovariectomized hamsters. These data support the hypothesis that the changing levels of estradiol and progesterone during the estrous cycle influence flank marking by altering the sensitivity or response of the MPOA-AH to AVP.},

In addition, under certain conditions parents and offspring are expected to disagree over the preferred sex of the potential offspring. In general, parent-offspring conflict is expected to increase during the period of parental care, and offspring are expected to employ psychological weapons in order to compete with their parents. Detailed data on mother-offspring relations in mammals are consistent with the arguments presented.

abstract = {Social living goes hand in hand with communication, but the details of this relationship are rarely simple. Complex communication may be described by attributes as diverse as a species' entire repertoire, signallers' individualistic signatures, or complex acoustic phenomena within single calls. Similarly, attributes of social complexity are diverse and may include group size, social role diversity, or networks of interactions and relationships. How these different attributes of social and communicative complexity co-evolve is an active question in behavioural ecology. Sciurid rodents (ground squirrels, prairie dogs and marmots) provide an excellent model system for studying these questions. Sciurid studies have found that demographic role complexity predicts alarm call repertoire size, while social group size predicts alarm call individuality. Along with other taxa, sciurids reveal an important insight: different attributes of sociality are linked to different attributes of communication. By breaking social and communicative complexity down to different attributes, focused studies can better untangle the underlying evolutionary relationships and move us closer to a comprehensive theory of how sociality and communication evolve.},

Oxtr(-/-) mice were viable and had no obvious deficits in fertility or reproductive behavior. Oxtr(-/-) dams exhibited normal parturition but demonstrated defects in lactation and maternal nurturing. Infant Oxtr(-/-) males emitted fewer ultrasonic vocalizations than wild-type littermates in response to social isolation. Adult Oxtr(-/-) males also showed deficits in social discrimination and elevated aggressive behavior. Ligand Oxt(-/-) males from Oxt(-/-) dams, but not from Oxt(+/-) dams, showed similar high levels of aggression.

abstract = {We recently demonstrated that vasopressin (AVP) in the lateral septum modulates social play behavior differently in male and female juvenile rats. However, the extent to which different social contexts (i.e., exposure to an unfamiliar play partner in different environments) affect the regulation of social play remains largely unknown. Given that AVP and the closely related neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) modulate social behavior as well as anxiety-like behavior, we hypothesized that these neuropeptides may regulate social play behavior differently in novel (novel cage) as opposed to familiar (home cage) social environments. Administration of the specific AVP V1a receptor (V1aR) antagonist (CH2)5Tyr(Me(2))AVP into the lateral septum enhanced home cage social play behavior in males but reduced it in females, confirming our previous findings. These effects were context-specific because V1aR blockade did not alter novel cage social play behavior in either sex. Furthermore, social play in females was reduced by AVP in the novel cage and by OXT in the home cage. Additionally, females administered the specific OXT receptor antagonist desGly-NH2,d(CH2)5-[Tyr(Me)(2),Thr(4)]OVT showed less social play in the novel as compared to the home cage. AVP enhanced anxiety-related behavior in males (tested on the elevated plus-maze), but failed to do so in females, suggesting that exogenous AVP alters social play and anxiety-related behavior via distinct and sex-specific mechanisms. Moreover, none of the other drug treatments that altered social play had an effect on anxiety, suggesting that these drug-induced behavioral alterations are relatively specific to social behavior. Overall, we showed that AVP and OXT systems in the lateral septum modulate social play in juvenile rats in neuropeptide-, sex- and social context-specific ways. These findings underscore the importance of considering not only sex, but also social context, in how AVP and OXT modulate social behavior.},

abstract = {In the rat, neonatal administration of testosterone propionate to a castrated male causes masculinization of behavior. However, if an intact male is treated neonatally with testosterone (hyper-androgen condition), male sexual behavior in adulthood is disrupted. There is a possibility that the hyper-androgen treatment is suppressing male sexual behavior by altering the male's partner preference and thereby reducing his motivation to approach the female. If so, this would suggest that exposure to supra-physiological levels of androgen during development may result in the development of male-oriented partner preference in the male. To test this idea, male rats were treated either postnatally or prenatally with testosterone, and partner preference and sexual behavior were examined in adulthood. The principal finding of this study was that increased levels of testosterone during early postnatal life, but not prenatal, decreased male sexual behavior and increased the amount of time a male spent with a stimulus male, without affecting the amount of time spent with a stimulus female during partner preference tests. Thus, the reduction in male sexual behavior produced by early exposure to high levels of testosterone is not likely due to a reduction in the male's motivation to approach a receptive female. ?? 2010.},

The characteristics of pheromone signal detection by vomeronasal neurons remain unclear3,5. Here we use a mouse VNO slice preparation to show that six putative pheromones evoke excitatory responses in single vomeronasal neurons, leading to action potential generation and elevated calcium entry. The detection threshold for some of these chemicals is remarkably low, near 10-11 M, placing these neurons among the most sensitive chemodetectors in mammals. Using confocal calcium imaging, we map the epithelial representation of the pheromones to show that each of the ligands activates a unique, nonoverlapping subset of vomeronasal neurons located in apical zones of the epithelium. These neurons show highly selective tuning properties and their tuning curves do not broaden with increasing concentrations of ligand, unlike those of receptor neurons in the main olfactory epithelium. These findings provide a basis for understanding chemical signals that regulate mammalian communication and sexual behaviour.},

abstract = {RNAseq is a relatively new tool for ecological genetics that offers researchers insight into changes in gene expression in response to a myriad of natural or experimental conditions. However, standard RNAseq methods (e.g., Illumina TruSeq{\textregistered} or NEBNext{\textregistered}) can be cost prohibitive, especially when study designs require large sample sizes. Consequently, RNAseq is often underused as a method, or is applied to small sample sizes that confer poor statistical power. Low cost RNAseq methods could therefore enable far greater and more powerful applications of transcriptomics in ecological genetics and beyond. Standard mRNAseq is costly partly because one sequences portions of the full length of all transcripts. Such whole-mRNA data are redundant for estimates of relative gene expression. TagSeq is an alternative method that focuses sequencing effort on mRNAs' 3' end, reducing the necessary sequencing depth per sample, and thus cost. We present a revised TagSeq library construction procedure, and compare its performance against NEBNext{\textregistered}, the ‘gold-standard' whole mRNAseq method. We built both TagSeq and NEBNext{\textregistered} libraries from the same biological samples, each spiked with control RNAs. We found that TagSeq measured the control RNA distribution more accurately than NEBNext{\textregistered}, for a fraction of the cost per sample ({\~{}}10{\%}). The higher accuracy of TagSeq was particularly apparent for transcripts of moderate to low abundance. Technical replicates of TagSeq libraries are highly correlated, and were correlated with NEBNext{\textregistered} results. Overall, we show that our modified TagSeq protocol is an efficient alternative to traditional whole mRNAseq, offering researchers comparable data at greatly reduced cost.},

abstract = {A three-year field-study of Richardson's ground squirrels was conducted to assess whether alarm calling functions to warn close relatives (“kin selection” hypothesis) or manipulate conspecifics (a “selfish” hypothesis). S. richardsonii had distinct calls for terrestrial and aerial predators, and the responses of squirrels varied appropriately according to the context of calls, implying that calling conveyed correct information concerning the nature of the danger. Alarm calling elicited by naturally occurring encounters with potential predators during 454 h of observation, and by a thrown frisbee in 70 experimental trials, was not equally probable for all age/sex classes. Squirrels were most likely to call when they had offspring or siblings nearby, which is supportive of the hypothesis that alarm calling is maintained by kin selection. Adult males, residing in the vicinity of either their probable progeny or their nonlittermate half-siblings, were the most likely age/sex class to call during the lactation period when young were below ground and were most vulnerable. I conclude that alarm calling by Richardson's ground squirrels is nepotistic rather than manipulative. Introduction},

abstract = {Central vasopressin pathways have been implicated in the mediation of paternal behavior, selective aggression, and affiliation in monogamous prairie voles. Here we demonstrate markedly different patterns of brain vasopressin receptor binding in the monogamous prairie vole and the congeneric nonmonogamous (promiscuous) montane vole. Vasopressin binding was assessed with both 3H-vasopressin and 125I-sarc-AVP using receptor autoradiography. The specificity of binding was consistent with a V1a receptor, the saturation kinetics were similar in the two species, and neither species showed evidence of sexual dimorphisms. In the prairie vole, highest specific binding was observed in the accessory olfactory bulb, diagonal band, laterodorsal thalamus, and superior colliculus. In the montane vole, specific binding was observed in the accessory olfactory bulb and superior colliculus as well, but in several other regions with high levels of binding in the prairie vole, binding was low or undetectable in the montane vole. In this nonmonogamous species, specific binding was high in lateral septum. Functional studies demonstrated the induction of phosphoinositol by AVP in the septum of the montane vole but not in the prairie vole. The pattern of 125I-sarc-AVP binding to lateral septum may reflect the social organization of these two species, as similar differences in AVP receptor distribution in the lateral septum were also observed in two related species, pine voles and meadow voles, which are monogamous and nonmonogamous, respectively. These results, along with earlier studies of AVP's effects on pair bonding, suggest the importance of this neuropeptide for the mediation of behaviors related to social organization.},

We examined whether reproductive tuco-tucos (Ctenomys talarum) were able to discriminate the reproductive condition, sex, and source population of conspecifics by means of chemical cues contained in urine, feces, soiled shavings, or anogenital secretions. During preference tests in which animals had direct contact with these chemical cues, tuco-tucos were able to determine the reproductive condition of opposite sex conspecifics independent of the source of odor. When only olfactory cues were available, both sexes discriminated reproductive condition of opposite sex individuals using urine. Females were also able to discriminate the reproductive condition of males using soiled shavings. Females spent more time investigating male odors than female odors; except in the case of feces, breeding males spent similar amounts of time investigating male and female odors. No preferences were detected for opposite sex urine from members of an animal's own versus another population. The role of chemical cues in territory defense and breeding performance by this highly territorial subterranean rodent is discussed.},

abstract = {We have previously reported that mice with a targeted disruption of their vasopressin 1b receptor gene, Avpr1b, have mild impairments in social recognition and reduced aggression. The reductions in aggression are limited to social forms of aggression, i.e., maternal and inter-male aggression, while predatory aggression remains unaffected. To further clarify the role of the Avpr1b in the regulation of social behavior we first examined anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in Avpr1b knockout (Avpr1b -/-) mice. We then went on to test the ability of Avpr1b -/- mice to form dominance hierarchies. No major differences were found between Avpr1b -/- and wildtype mice in anxiety-like behaviors, as measured using an elevated plus maze and an open field test, or depression-like behaviors, as measured using a forced swim test. In the social dominance study we found that Avpr1b -/- mice are able to form dominance hierarchies, though in early hierarchy formation dominant Avpr1b -/- mice display significantly more mounting behavior on Day 1 of testing compared to wildtype controls. Further, non-socially dominant Avpr1b -/- mice spend less time engaged in attack behavior than wildtype controls. These findings suggest that while Avpr1b -/- mice may be able to form dominance hierarchies they appear to employ alternate strategies.},

abstract = {Common vampire bats often regurgitate food to roost-mates that fail to feed. The original explanation for this costly helping behaviour invoked both direct and indirect fitness benefits. Several authors have since suggested that food sharing is maintained solely by indirect fitness because non-kin food sharing could have resulted from kin recognition errors, indiscriminate altruism within groups, or harassment. To test these alternatives, we examined predictors of food-sharing decisions under controlled conditions of mixed relatedness and equal familiarity. Over a 2 year period, we individually fasted 20 vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and induced food sharing on 48 days. Surprisingly, donors initiated food sharing more often than recipients, which is inconsistent with harassment. Food received was the best predictor of food given across dyads, and 8.5 times more important than relatedness. Sixty-four per cent of sharing dyads were unrelated, approaching the 67 per cent expected if nepotism was absent. Consistent with social bonding, the food-sharing network was consistent and correlated with mutual allogrooming. Together with past work, these findings support the hypothesis that food sharing in vampire bats provides mutual direct fitness benefits, and is not explained solely by kin selection or harassment.},

abstract = {Chronic administration of phencyclidine (PCP) has been advanced as a valid animal model of the social deficit symptoms of schizophrenia. In these studies, the cumulative time that male rats treated once a day for 14 days with PCP actively engaged in social behavior was decreased approximately 75{\%} relative to saline-treated control animals. In addition, these socially impaired rats had an increase in the relative amount of noncontact interactions compared with saline-injected peers. Social behaviors were preferentially affected by PCP treatment because in two anxiety-related behavioral assays, the open field and light/dark emergence tests, there was a failure to differentiate between the PCP-treated rats and saline-injected control rats. Considering the general importance of the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin in male social behaviors, studies of molecular markers related to these neuropeptides were performed. Hypothalamic oxytocin mRNA expression was significantly decreased while oxytocin receptor binding was increased in the central nucleus of the amygdala following chronic PCP treatment. Given the significance of central nucleus of the amygdala in social behavior, oxytocin was infused into the central nucleus of experimental and control male rats, and their postinfusion social interaction and open field behaviors were analyzed. A bilateral infusion of 1 mug of oxytocin into the central amygdala selectively restored the normal quantity and quality of social behavior in chronic PCP-treated male rats without altering open field behaviors. These findings suggest that deficits in the central oxytocinergic system may underlie the social impairment exhibited in this animal model of schizophrenia.},

In the present experiment, giant African pouched rats were trained to respond to filters that had been stored together with cigarettes (i.e., soaked) and to not respond to filters that had been soaked with noncigarette items. Generalization to untrained types of tobacco was then tested. The sensitivity of 4 rats trained on filters soaked with 1 of 7 types of cigarettes ranged from 86{\%} to 100{\%} (mean, 95{\%}). There was very little evidence of generalization when the rats were tested on tobacco leaves and snuff but good evidence of generalization when the rats were tested on cigarettes that had been soaked with strong-smelling additives. These findings suggest that rats may be a valuable asset in the global effort to control illicit cigarette trade.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of displaying Malaysian peacock pheasants was documented at a site in Peninsular Malaysia. Calling males were clustered and, therefore, were not evenly distributed throughout the available habitat. The location of these clusters differed between calling periods. An objective method of assessing micro-habitat structure at the forest-floor level was devised to investigate habitat use by displaying males. Habitat structure was measured at 197 points throughout the study site, both in areas used by the pheasant and in those areas not used by the pheasant. A DECORANA ordination revealed that two gradients explained much of the variation in micro-habitat structure. Male calling clusters were located in areas that were away from the river and more stable (e.g. fewer treefalls). Within these clusters, display scrapes were sited in areas that were more stable and were more influenced by the rivers than elsewhere within the area used by the calling males. It is suggested that the environmental gradients described by the ordination are more likely to determine the position of the calling cluster than individual habitat structure variables. Within calling clusters, however, it seems probable that the presence or absence of ground-level vegetation directly influences the siting of display scrapes.},

abstract = {Although previous studies have demonstrated that exogenous administration of oxytocin (OT) enhances sexual receptivity in female rats, there is no compelling evidence that endogenous OT has a physiological role in the regulation of female sexual behavior. In the current studies we centrally administered d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2Thr4,Tyr-NH2(9)]ornithine vasotocin (or OTA), a selective OT receptor antagonist, to block endogenous OT in ovariectomized females primed with different levels of gonadal steroids. After OTA administration (100-1000 ng), females primed with estradiol benzoate (EB; 1 microgram) and progesterone (P; 250 micrograms) showed reductions in both receptive and proceptive behaviors. These effects of OTA were also evident, though less striking, in females primed with higher doses of EB (10 micrograms) and P (250 micrograms), but significant OTA effects were absent in females primed with EB (10 micrograms) alone. Thus, OTA appeared to attenuate P's facilitation of sexual behavior. Surprisingly, these behavioral effects of OTA administration were not apparent immediately, but emerged only when OTA was given with P 4-6 h before behavioral testing. To determine if these delayed, but lasting, behavioral effects were associated with OTA occupancy of the OT receptor, we measured OT receptor binding ex vivo using receptor autoradiography. Six hours after intracerebroventricular administration of OTA (1000 ng), OT receptor binding was reduced at least 75{\%} in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus relative to control levels of binding. Thus, those OT receptors previously implicated in the regulation of sexual receptivity appear to be significantly blocked throughout the period of OTA's behavioral effects. Together, these studies lend support to the hypothesis that endogenous OT has a physiological role in the regulation of female sexual behavior.},

abstract = {We studied two courtship displays of male peafowl (Pavo cristatus), focusing particularly on male orientation relative to the position of the sun. During the "wing-shaking" display, females were generally behind the displaying male, and male orientation with respect to the position of the sun was not significantly different from random. However, during the pre-copulatory "train-rattling" display, males were on average directed at about 45 ° to the right of the sun azimuth with the female positioned directly in front, suggesting that this behaviour is involved in the communication of a visual signal. A model presentation experiment confirmed that courting peacocks were more likely to perform the train-rattling display when the female was on the sunny side of their erect train, but more likely to perform wing-shaking behaviour when the female was on the shaded side of the male. This study underscores the importance of visual signalling in peafowl courtship, and we suggest that an angle of about 45 ° relative to the sun may allow males to enhance the appearance of their iridescent eyespot feathers.},

We analyzed expression profiles for 10 neurochemical genes across 12 brain regions important for decision-making in 88 species representing five vertebrate lineages. We found that behaviorally relevant brain regions are remarkably conserved over 450 million years of evolution. We also find evidence that different brain regions have experienced different selection pressures, because spatial distribution of neuroendocrine ligands are more flexible than their receptors across vertebrates. Our analysis suggests that the diversity of social behavior in vertebrates can be explained, in part, by variations on a theme of conserved neural and gene expression networks.},

abstract = {Given the key role of pheromones in animal communication and behaviour, there is need to identify the different classes of these molecules under varying physiological conditions. However, the highly volatile nature of pheromones and the fact that they occur at very low concentrations in urine makes this task all the more difficult. Herein, we present a method of detecting and identifying the five main pheromones known: 2-sec-butyl-4,5- dihydrothiazole, geraniol, indole, trans-beta farnesene and trans-alpha farnesene in individual urine microsamples taken from male mice. Urine volumes as small as 20$\mu$l were subjected to solid phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This selective analytical method permits the rapid detection of these pheromones free from cross-contaminants as a clearly distinguishable spectral signals. Highest recovery rates of natural pheromones were achieved by extraction on a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) fibre of 85$\mu$m film thickness. This selective, sensitive and accurate method will help address the question of possible links between certain pheromone classes, and social and reproductive behaviour in mice. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To investigate the social roles of countermarking in dogs, we measured tail base position (TBP, a measure of social status), adjacent-marking and overmarking responses of male, nonoestrous female, gonadectomized male and gonadectomized female dogs to controlled presentations of urine from unfamiliar dogs and social groupmates. We also recorded dog sex, TBP, countermarking and urine investigation at a park. In urine presentations, only males overmarked, intact males (but not gonadectomized males) preferentially overmarked intact female urine, overmarking males had higher TBP than males that did not countermark and urine familiarity did not affect overmarking. In contrast, dogs adjacent-marked only unfamiliar samples, and neither sex nor TBP significantly affected adjacent marking. Gonadectomy did not significantly change the likelihood of countermarking. In dog park observations, males and females marked at and investigated 'scent posts' comprised of serial countermarks, often associated with visual landmarks. Males and females were equally likely to countermark and investigate urine and countermarks made up a similarly large portion of countermarking for males and females. Males and females with higher TBP urinated, investigated urine, and countermarked more than same-sex dogs with lower TBP. These studies suggest that although intact males may overmark female urine in part to guard mates as previously hypothesized, both sexes, intact and gonadectomized, likely countermark competitively. Social and sexual patterns also suggest that overmarks and adjacent marks may be distinct signals. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Giant pandas Ailuropoda melanoleuca are a solitary, seasonally mono-oestrous species, and as such are likely to rely heavily on chemical signals to co-ordinate mating efforts. Perhaps the most crucial chemosensory task facing male pandas is the assessment of female reproductive condition on the basis of chemical cues. To test for this ability, eight male and 10 female giant pandas were presented with urine from oestrous and non-oestrous females. Males but not females displayed a significant investigatory preference for oestrous over non-oestrous female urine, as indicated by sniffing and flehmen. Males also investigated, displayed flehmen, and licked female urine more than did females. These findings indicate that female urine contains chemical cues permitting discrimination of oestrous status, and probably serves a reproductive advertisement function. The prevalence of flehmen and licking by males suggests that males may rely on the vomeronasal organ to assess female reproductive condition. Female odours may play an important role in the reproductive behaviour of male giant pandas and, therefore, may have implications for captive-breeding programmes.},

abstract = {Anogenital distance (AGD) in rodents is a useful indicator of masculinization or feminization due to prenatal hormonal effects. If such cues convey useful information about both 'maleness' and more importantly mate quality, then females may select males based on this cue or other cues related to it. We tested this hypothesis by asking if female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) preferred males with relatively longer AGDs and if AGD correlated with fitness enhancing characteristics such as sperm count, sperm size, and gonad size. Not only did preferred males have significantly longer AGD and larger testes than nonpreferred males, but AGD was directly related to the testes size, seminal vesicle size, and the number of sperm stored. We re-evaluated data collected in semi-natural field enclosures and discovered that males that were members of a pairbond had longer AGD than single males. This later result, taken under semi-natural conditions, was consistent with results we obtained in the laboratory. Taken together these data indicate that AGD serves as a useful cue of male potency and that females preferentially associate with males that demonstrate this masculinized phenotype. Moreover, these data imply that females may select mates based on their potential to effectively fertilize ova, a potentially important trait for a species that forms life-long pairbonds. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The responses of individual resident males in four classes (dominant and subdominant adults, subadults and juveniles) were measured towards familiar resident, familiar neighbour and unfamiliar urine marks from dominant and subadult males, and towards a clean patch of substrate, introduced into their family-marked territory. Attraction, avoidance, investigation and counter-marking responses were consistent with the hypothesis that territorial males mark at high frequency to advertise their aggressive dominance over other resident and intruder males. Dominant males counter-marked resident and non-resident male marks strongly, while dominant male marks were investigated closely by males subordinate to the mark donor. Both dominant and subordinate males appear to use dominant male marks to orient to their resident territory and away from areas marked by other dominant males. ?? 1990 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {The limbic localization of the arginine vasopressin V(1b) receptor has prompted speculation as to a potential role of this receptor in the control of emotional processes. To investigate this possibility, we have studied the behavioral effects of SSR149415, the first selective and orally active non-peptide antagonist of vasopressin V(1b) receptors, in a variety of classical (punished drinking, elevated plus-maze, and light/dark tests) and atypical (fear/anxiety defense test battery and social defeat-induced anxiety) rodent models of anxiety, and in two models of depression [forced swimming and chronic mild stress (CMS)]. When tested in classical tests of anxiety, SSR149415 produced anxiolytic-like activity at doses that ranged from 1 to 30 mg/kg (i.p. or p.o.), but the magnitude of these effects was overall less than that of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam, which was used as a positive control. In contrast, SSR149415 produced clear-cut anxiolytic-like activity in models involving traumatic stress exposure, such as the social defeat paradigm and the defense test battery (1-30 mg/kg, p.o.). In the forced swimming test, SSR149415 (10-30 mg/kg, p.o.) produced antidepressant-like effects in both normal and hypophysectomized rats. Moreover, in the CMS model in mice, repeated administration of SSR149415 (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) for 39 days improved the degradation of the physical state, anxiety, despair, and the loss of coping behavior produced by stress. These findings point to a role for vasopressin in the modulation of emotional processes via the V(1b) receptor, and suggest that its blockade may represent a novel avenue for the treatment of affective disorders.},

Findings show that females that mated only with a single, recently mated male ran a high risk of pseudopregnancy or reduced litter size. Females paired with males that had mated to satiety 30 min, 8 hrs, or 24 hrs earlier showed a reduced willingness to engage in lordosis than did females paired with a sexually rested (2 wks) male. Females paired with recently mated males were also more likely to mate with additional (fresh) males than were females exposed to rested males. Females presented with 2 anesthetized stimulus males readily discriminated between sexually rested and recently mated individuals. Neither prior sexual experience nor recent copulatory activity was required for this discrimination. It is suggested that multiple-male mating (promiscuity) in female hamsters may be an adaptation against an infertile mating as a consequence of mating with a single, recently mated, sperm-depleted male.

If receivers of alarm calls differentiate among callers, they could use that information to tailor their behavioural response to the perceived level of threat. A neighbour's call may indicate more imminent danger than that of a non-neighbour; with individual recognition, recipients could adjust their response according to the reliability of the caller. I elicited and recorded alarm calls of juvenile Richardson's ground squirrels using an avian predator model. Series of five calls were then played back to focal juveniles in the field. Within each series, playbacks involved an initial ‘habituation series' of four calls of either a neighbour or a non-neighbour. In ‘control' series, the fifth call was from the same individual but differed from the four preceding it. In ‘experimental' series, the fifth call was from a different individual than those played earlier. Juveniles showed greater vigilance in response to playbacks of neighbours' calls relative to non-neighbours' calls, but habituated rapidly to call playbacks, showing a significant decline in vigilance by the second call. In control series, a different call from the same individual did not significantly increase vigilance. In experimental series, a call from adifferent individual restored vigilance to a level similar to that recorded prior to habituation. These results suggest that juvenile Richardson's ground squirrels discriminate among callers and use that ability to respond differentially to alarm calls issued by neighbours and non-neighbours.},

abstract = {Female mice were delivered by Caesearian section, with females between 2 male fetuses in the uterus (2M females) and females not contiguous to males in the uterus (OM females) being compared morphologically, physiologically and behaviorally during later life. The results reveal that 2M females are masculinized morphologically and behaviorally relative to 0M females; 2M females have a larger anogenital space, are more aggressive in a variety of different situations, are less effective at inhibiting male-induced puberty when group housed and urine mark their environment at higher rates (all masculine traits). On the other hand, 0M females are more sexually attractive and arousing to males than are 2M females. While no differences were noted between 0M and 2M females in terms of their sensitivity to gonadal steroids or in their capacity to produce and raise healthy young in an optimal laboratory environment, the data indicate that in utero contiguity to male fetuses produces a masculine bias in the transmission of and response to reproductively important social cues. Such a bias could alter the probability of mating and of successfully producing healthy offspring in a natural environment.},

abstract = {A habituation-discrimination technique was used to demonstrate that male and female prairie voles can discriminate individual differences in the odours of soiled shavings and urine from male and female conspecifics. A second experiment, employing a Y-maze, showed that females significantly preferred the odours of their mate over those of either another mated male or an unmated male. Males preferred their mate's odours to those of other mated females but showed no significant preference between the odours of their mate and those of a virgin female. A third experiment demonstrated that, over a 10-h period, females built nests and/or stayed preferentially on the side of a Y-maze containing their mate's odours. Likewise, males preferentially built nests in their mate's side compared to the side containing odours from a virgin female. However, although the same trend was present when mate odours were paired with odours from another mated female, the preference was not statistically significant. Taken as a whole, these results indicate that mate recognition may be an important of individually distinctive odours in this species. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {Blood samples were taken from free-living male and female mockingbirds to determine correlations between plasma steroids and breeding behavior. Plasma levels of testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), and corticosterone (B) were assessed during pre-breeding courtship, while males built nests, while females incubated, while parents fed young, and while males built new nests as pairs continued to care for dependent fledglings, Samples were also taken from unmated males holding spring territories. In males, T and P fluctuated with breeding phase, and in all groups, male T levels exceeded basal values measured in autumn. But, when mated males built nests in the absence of young, T levels were higher than in all other conditions, though only for early broods. In females too, T and P levels changed with breeding phase; T levels rose during courtship and while males built first nests and were intermediate during nest construction for later broods. Male and female P levels rose during courtship and when males built nests with young present. While feeding young in the nest, males showed significantly higher corticosterone levels than females, though in females, both P and B levels increased during incubation for replacement broods. These findings strengthen an earlier finding that T may activate male nest construction, and they suggest that breeding behavior may be related to T in females as well. Progesterone data raise the possibility that P too, may be linked to breeding behavior in male and female mockingbirds. Sex differences in corticosterone levels during the nestling period may reveal subtle costs associated with male mockingbirds' highly aggressive defense against predators.

abstract = {We conducted a series of experiments to discern among the counter-marking, over-marking, and self-advertisement hypotheses for secondary marking in male prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, and meadow voles, M. pennsylvanicus. Secondary scent marks (those placed in an area that has already been marked by a conspecific) were not significantly greater than initial marks placed on clean substrate (a substrate without any previous scent marks) for either species and thus did not support a counter-marking hypothesis. Similarly, overlapping of initial scent marks with secondary marks occurred less often than expected by chance and did not support an over-marking hypothesis. Secondary marks tended to avoid overlap with scent marks previously deposited by a potential competitor. Our results suggest that secondary scent marking functions to self-advertise by maximizing individual identity and avoiding masking or blending with previous donors. Future studies on secondary marking should be designed to quantify the observed and expected frequency and placement of original and secondary marks to discern among alternative hypotheses for the adaptive significance of secondary marking.},

abstract = {The ability to smell is governed by the largest gene family in mammalian genomes, the olfactory receptor (OR) genes. Although these genes are well annotated in the finished human and mouse genomes, we still do not understand which receptors bind specific odorants or how they fully function. Previous comparative studies have been taxonomically limited and mostly focused on the percentage of OR pseudogenes within species. No study has investigated the adaptive changes of functional OR gene families across phylogenetically and ecologically diverse mammals. To determine the extent to which OR gene repertoires have been influenced by habitat, sensory specialization, and other ecological traits, to better understand the functional importance of specific OR gene families and thus the odorants they bind, we compared the functional OR gene repertoires from 50 mammalian genomes. We amplified more than 2000 OR genes in aquatic, semi-aquatic, and flying mammals and coupled these data with 48,000 OR genes from mostly terrestrial mammals, extracted from genomic projects. Phylogenomic, Bayesian assignment, and principle component analyses partitioned species by ecotype (aquatic, semi-aquatic, terrestrial, flying) rather than phylogenetic relatedness, and identified OR families important for each habitat. Functional OR gene repertoires were reduced independently in the multiple origins of aquatic mammals and were significantly divergent in bats. We reject recent neutralist views of olfactory subgenome evolution and correlate specific OR gene families with physiological requirements, a preliminary step toward unraveling the relationship between specific odors and respective OR gene families.},

MeA-lesioned rats exhibited a significant reduction in freezing duration and made frequent contact with a cloth containing cat odor. In contrast, CeA lesions had no significant effects on unconditioned fear. The freezing reduction produced by MeA lesions was not due to a performance deficit because MeA-lesioned rats, unlike CeA-lesioned rats, were capable of freezing in postshock test intervals. Furthermore, MeA lesions did not alter olfactory function and general locomotor activity. Results demonstrate that the MeA plays a major role in modulating predator odor-induced unconditioned fear.},

In Britain, the African giant rat is increasingly becoming a popular exotic pet. A survey was conducted on 41 licensed pet shops in the UK. The range of ages of giant rat presented for sale, single price per rat, paired prices (buck and doe) and transport costs were 4–12 weeks, {\pounds}320–{\pounds}370, {\pounds}352.50–400.00 including VAT, and {\pounds}10–37.50, respectively. Ivermectin injected at 200-400 µg/kg subcutaneously once a week for 3 weeks will eliminate ectoparasites (and many endoparasites). Nematode infections can also be treated with fenbendazole or piperazine. Bladder threadworms can be treated with fenbendazole, protozoa with metronidazole (not in gravid does) and cestodes with praziquantel. Treatment of leptospirosis with doxycycline administered 4.29–5.36 mg once a week is useful prophylactically, although for insurance of effectiveness, 10 mg/kg for 5 days is recommended. An identical dosage is recommended for the treatment of rickettsia. African trypanosomosis infection, following diagnosis of parasites in a blood smear, can be treated with a variety of antiprotozoal drugs like diminazene diaceturate at 3.5 mg/kg for 5 days. Leishmaniasis is treated at the same dose. Staphylococcosis is treated with amoxycillian trihydrate at 5 mg/kg 3 times a day for 7 days. Helminthosis is treated with broad-spectrum deworming solution. Coccidiosis is treated with cotrimoxazole at 100 mg/kg daily for 3 days. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are administered to combat secondary bacterial infection after viral invasion.},

We analyzed urine from three subterranean rodent genera from different continents, and with diverse social systems: eusocial Zambian mole-rats (Fukomys), solitary Israeli blind mole rats (Spalax), and social Chilean coruros (Spalacopus). 2D gel electrophoresis revealed low levels of protein, with sequences similar to aphrodisin, in Fukomys mole-rat urine, but no MUPs in urine of any of the studied species. Previous research demonstrated that subjects from the tested genera responded differentially to odors indicating transmission of individuality, family/colony or population, species, and reproductive state in secretions and excretions of conspecifics. This extends, to subterranean rodents, the evidence that rodent species can successfully transmit and receive chemosignals without the necessity of MUPs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Its receptor (Oxtr) is present in peripheral tissues and brain, so a conditional knockout (KO, -/-) would be useful to allow elimination of the receptor in specific sites at defined times. We created a line of mice in which loxP sites flank Oxtr coding sequence (floxed) enable Cre recombinase-mediated inactivation of the receptor. We expressed Cre recombinase in these mice either in all tissues (Oxtr(-/-)) or the forebrain (Oxtr(FB/FB)) using the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha promoter. The latter KO has reduced Oxtr binding beginning 21-28 d postnatally, leading to prominent reductions in the lateral septum, hippocampus, and ventral pallidum. The medial amygdala is spared, and there is significant retention of binding within the olfactory bulb and nucleus and neocortex. We did not observe any deficits in the general health, sensorimotor functions, anxiety-like behaviors, or sucrose intake in either Oxtr(-/-) or Oxtr(FB/FB) mice. Females of both KO types deliver pups, but only the Oxtr(FB/FB) mice are able to eject milk. Oxtr(-/-) males show impaired social memory for familiar females, whereas the Oxtr(FB/FB) males appear to recognize their species but not individuals. Our results confirm the importance of oxytocin in social recognition and demonstrate that spatial and temporal inactivation of the Oxtr will enable finer understanding of the physiological, behavioral, and developmental roles of the receptor.},

Subchronic phencyclidine (PCP) administration (2 mg/kg/day, 14 days, i.p.) significantly reduced the density of V1a receptor binding sites, labeled by an [125I]-Linear AVP antagonist, in several brain regions. Subchronic treatment with PCP or MK-801 (0.13 mg/kg/day, 14 days, i.p.) impaired social interactions in rats, as has been previously reported.

The present study was designed to further characterize biochemical parameters of 2M and 0M adult male mice. Activities of testicular steroidogenic enzymes, namely delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, and C17,20-lyase (C21SCC P450), were measured by means of radiometric assays and HPLC fractionation of substrate and products. Activity of 5 alpha-reductase in both seminal vesicle and prostate was measured by similar techniques. Estrogen and androgen receptor concentrations, which indicate capacity to respond to steroid hormones, were also examined in the accessory sex organs. For both seminal vesicle and prostate, 5 alpha-reductase activities were approximately 60{\%} greater in 2M males than in 0M males, indicating greater capacity to form dihydrotestosterone from testosterone in organs from 2M mice. No significant differences were found in testicular steroidogenic enzymes between 2M and 0M animals, whereas the trend for all three activities was higher for 2M males than for 0M males. While no differences were found in estrogen receptor concentrations, 0M prostates had three times the concentration of androgen receptors (occupied receptors) compared to 2M prostates. Our findings suggest that intrauterine fetal position exerts a significant influence on subsequent adult androgen metabolism and androgen responsiveness in reproductive organs of adult male mice.},

abstract = {The ever present threat of viral, bacterial, protozoan and metazoan parasites in the environment of wild animals is viewed as responsible for the natural selection of a variety of behavioral patterns that enable animals to survive and reproduce in this type of environment. Several lines of research, some quite recent, point to five behavioral strategies that vertebrates utilize to increase their personal or inclusive fitness in the face of parasites (broadly defined to include pathogens). These are: 1) avoidance of parasites; 2) controlled exposure to parasites to potentiate the immune system; 3) behavior of sick animals including anorexia and depression to overcome systemic febrile infections; 4) helping sick animals; 5) sexual selection for mating partners with the genetic endowment for resistance to parasites. The point is made that to consider a behavioral pattern as having evolved to serve a parasite control function the parasite or causative agent should be shown to adversely impact the animal's fitness and the behavior in question must be shown to help animals, or their offspring or group mates, in combating their exposure, or reducing their vulnerability, to the parasite. {\textcopyright} 1990 Pergamon Press plc.},

@article{Emlen1977,
abstract = {We have attempted to provide an ecological framework for understanding and predicting the forms of animal mating systems. The underlying assumption is that intrasexual interactions associated with mating are basically competitive. An individual member of the limited sex is expected to maximize its inclusive fitness by attempting to control access to mates of the limiting sex. The degree to which this is possible depends on the costs and benefits associated with such control. Certain environmental factors, particularly the spatial dispersion pattern of key resources and the temporal availability of receptive mates, are important determinants of these costs and benefits. The greater the potential for individuals to monopolize resources or mates, the greater the intensity of sexual selection and the greater the environmental potential for polygamy. The precise form of the mating system will depend on which sex is limiting and on the manner and the degree to which the limited sex controls the resource base or monopolizes mates (or both). An ecological categorization of mating systems is presented (Table 1) that allows a better understanding of the selective forces shaping one mating system over another. Within this ecological framework, specific examples are discussed ranging from the occurrence of leks to the evolution of polyandry.},

abstract = {We studied a population of rufous whistlers, Pachycephala rufiventris, throughout a single breeding season in central New South Wales, Australia. We evaluated the relation between plasma testosterone (T) and reproductive behaviors using both simulated territorial intrusions (STIs) and subcutaneous T implants. We compared circulating T values to aggression levels of males (using STI) during pair bond and territory establishment and again during incubation. Although plasma T levels were significantly lower in the latter period, male responsiveness to STI, in terms of proximity to decoy, call rate, and number of attacks on the decoy, was indistinguishable between the two breeding stages. T levels of males exposed to STI were not different from the levels of unexposed free-living males at the same breeding stage. The effect of exogenous T on parental behavior was examined by comparing duration of incubation bouts of males and their mates prior to and after T treatment. T males significantly reduced the amount of time they incubated following implantation, whereas Control males maintained their incubation effort. After cessation of breeding activities, T males displayed significantly higher call rates due to increased use of the primary intersexual advertisement call in this species. The reduction of incubation behavior following T implantation emphasises the functional significance of the rapid decline in T in free-living males during incubation. The results from both experiments suggest that intersexual advertisement, rather than territorial aggression, may be dependent on high T levels in this species.},

abstract = {We characterized the reproductive cycle of Octodon degus to determine whether reproductive maturation is spontaneous in juveniles and if ovarian cyclicity and luteal function are spontaneous in adults. Laboratory-reared prepubertal and adult females were monitored for vaginal patency and increased wheel-running. Sexual receptivity was assessed by pairing adult females with a male 1) continuously, 2) at the time of vaginal patency, or 3) following estradiol treatment. Blood samples were assayed for estradiol and progesterone concentrations on Days 1, 4, 8, and 16 relative to vaginal opening. Ovarian tissues were collected 6 and 16 days after behavioral estrus and 6 days after copulation for histology. In juveniles, the onset of cyclic vaginal patency and increased wheel-running activity was spontaneous, occurred in the absence of proximal male cues, and appeared at regular intervals (17.5 ± 1.4 days). In adults, vaginal patency and increased wheel-running occurred cyclically (21.2 ± 0.6 days) in the absence of proximal male cues, and these traits predicted the time of sexual receptivity. Corpora lutea develop spontaneously and are maintained for 12-14 days. The ovaries had well-developed corpora lutea 6 days after mating and 6 days after estrus without mating. Progesterone concentrations were highest in the second half of the cycle when corpora lutea were present and estradiol concentrations peaked on the day of estrus. Thus, female degus appear to exhibit a spontaneous reproductive cycle consistent with other Hystricognathi rodents. Octodon degus is a novel model with which to examine the mechanisms underlying different reproductive cycles. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.},

This reactivity to a range of stimuli, and the different behaviors by which such fear or defensiveness may be expressed, including flight, freezing, vocalization, the jump-attack, and specific biting patterns, make wild rats very appropriate subjects for the analysis of brain mechanisms underlying fear. Lesions of the mesencephalic central gray dramatically lowered these defensive reactions to both painful and nonpainful threat stimuli, reducing or eliminating each of the defensive reactions measured. The subjects showed no evidence of significant motor impairment or disturbance of primary sensory mechanisms. Because these experimental lesions involved considerable damage to the superior colliculi, a second study used wild rats with damage only to the colliculi. These animals displayed some deficits in visually guided behavior and in reactivity to certain tactile stimuli, but most of their fear reactions were intact. These findings suggest that the mesencephalic central gray, traditionally regarded as involved in reactivity to pain, may be one component of a mechanism underlying fear and defensive behaviors to nonpainful as well as noxious stimuli.},

abstract = {Nearly all the experimental mice used in aging research are derived from lineages that have been selected for many generations for adaptation to laboratory breeding conditions and are subsequently inbred. To see if inbreeding and laboratory adaptation might have altered the frequencies of genes that influence life span, we have developed three lines of mice (Idaho [Id], Pohnpei [Po], and Majuro [Ma]) from wild-trapped progenitors, and have compared them with a genetically heterogeneous mouse stock (DC) representative of the laboratory-adapted gene pool. Mean life span of the Id stock exceeded that of the DC stock by 24{\%} (P {\textless} 0.00002), and maximal life span, estimated as mean longevity of the longest-lived 10{\%} of the mice, was also increased by 16{\%} (P {\textless} 0.003). Mice of the Ma stock also had a significantly longer maximal longevity than DC mice (9{\%}, P = 0.04). The longest-lived Id mouse died at the age of 1450 days, which appears to exceed the previous longevity record for fully fed, non-mutant mice. The life table of the Po mice resembled that of the DC controls. Ma and Id mice differ from DC mice in several respects: both are shorter and lighter, and females of both stocks, particularly Id, are much slower to reach sexual maturity. As young adults, Id mice have lower levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), leptin, and glycosylated hemoglobin compared with DC controls, implicating several biochemical pathways as potential longevity mediators. The results support the idea that inadvertent selection for rapid maturation and large body size during the adaptation of the common stocks of laboratory mice may have forced the loss of natural alleles that retard the aging process. Genes present in the Id and Ma stocks may be valuable tools for the analysis of the physiology and biochemistry of aging in mice.},

We studied the relation between testosterone (T) and VP in male mice, which were genetically selected for their differences in aggression level. Aggressive males, characterized by a short attack latency (SAL), have a higher production capacity of T at adult age compared to males with a long attack latency (LAL). Neonatally, however, a higher T production occurs in the nonaggressive LAL males than in SAL males. In the present study we showed a more dense VP- immunoreactive (VP-ir) innervation in the LS and a higher VP-ir neuron density in the BNST of LAL males as compared to SAL males. The described differences may be the consequence of a differential neonatal androgen effect on the organization of the forebrain vasopressinergic network. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Southern giant pouched rats (Cricetomys spp.) are large rodents in the family Nesomyidae, native to sub-Saharan Africa, that are best known for their olfactory abilities. In fact, because of their acute olfactory abilities, they are used to detect explosives such as landmines. Understanding the natural scent-marking behaviors of animals in this family seems particularly relevant considering the olfactory nature of biodetection and the importance of olfactory communication among rodents in general. For many rodent species, individuals use scent marking to communicate social information to conspecifics. Countermarking (i.e., depositing scent marks either on top of or adjacent to preexisting scent marks of conspecifics) is a primary way rodents communicate information to conspecifics, and countermarks can serve as both intra- and intersexual signals. We presented male southern giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei) with male urine marks in novel and familiar environments to determine how and where these animals might countermark. A subset of male pouched rats used urine, anogenital, or cheek rubbing to mark adjacent to the preexisting mark in the novel environment only. No males marked in a familiar environment. We suggest that males countermark adjacent to existing marks in novel environments to advertise individual identity to conspecifics while preserving the identity of others.},

Because OR genes are intronless, it is possible to find all OR genes by conducting homology searches against the genome sequences using known OR genes as queries. However, some caution is necessary during the process of extracting intact coding sequences of OR genes and distinguishing among OR and non-OR genes.

abstract = {This mini-review on Fragrance Chemistry focuses on milestones in the timelines of musk, ionone/ woody and sandalwood odorants, as well as on new perspectives arising from the development of fragrance precursors. After a brief introduction of the history of perfumery, its mutual interaction with the chemistry of odorants, and the current state of the fragrance industry, the whole spectrum of musk odorants is discussed from the accidental discovery of nitro musks like Musk Ketone{\textregistered} via the parallel evolution of benzenoid and macrocyclic musks, to new structures like Cyclomusk{\textregistered} and Moxalone{\textregistered}. Following a description of the structure elucidation of violet odorants, ionone and irone, lso ESuper{\textregistered} and the structurally related Georgywood{\textregistered}, but also Koavone{\textregistered} and Timberol{\textregistered} are treated. Weissenborn's discovery of terpenylcyclohexanols lead to sandalwood synthetics that today are mainly derivatives of campholenic aldehyde like Sandalore{\textregistered}, Sandal Mysore Core{\textregistered}, Polysantol{\textregistered}, Ebanol{\textregistered}, and Javanol{\textregistered}. Finally, lipase labile precursor systems, for instance digeranyl succinate, or UV-radiation labile ones like citronellyl coumarate and citronellyl cyclohexylglyoxylate are presented, and views on 'secondary benefits', 'anti-perfumes' and exclusive 'Editions de Parfums' conclude this overview on the driving forces and the serendipities in the chemistry of fragrant substances.},

abstract = {Background Human and animal studies have found an association between prenatal androgen exposure and the anogenital distance (AGD). The aims of this study were to study the association between female AGD, reproductive health and background characteristics. Methods This was a cross sectional study, in which AGD were measured in 300 pregnant women who were recruited early during the first stage of labor. Demographic and health characteristics were collected and studied in association with AGD measurements. Results AGD presented with normal distribution (mean 40.3 mm ± 10.7) and was positively associated with maternal age (beta = 0.032, 95{\%}CI 0.007–0.05, p = 0.01) and negatively associated with infertility treatments (beta = −1.06, 95{\%}CI −1.99 to −0.12, p = 0.03). AGD was not associated with parity, ethnicity, height and other characteristics. Conclusions Adult females AGD is associated with age and fertility problems. Adult female AGD, used as a marker of early life exposure to EDCs, is possibly associated with reproductive characteristics.

abstract = {Anogenital distance (AGD) is longer in male than in female neonatal rodents, but can be altered by the prenatal environment. The aim of this experiment was to examine the effects of the sex composition of the litter on AGD in a species with a small litter size. We found that the AGD distributions of male and female California mice, Peromyscus californicus, overlap before weaning (33 days of age), but after weaning, males have a larger AGD than females. Because AGD is significantly correlated with body mass in both males and females, we analyzed the effect of the sex composition of the litter on AGD, using ANCOVA on logarithmically transformed data, with the logarithm of body mass as the covariate. We showed that the sex composition of the litter does not affect AGD in males but has an effect on the AGD in females at birth and this effect is significant at 33 days of age. Females from litters composed of more than 75{\%} males had a longer AGD than those born in litters composed principally of females. This s...},

S. richardsonii had distinct calls for terrestrial and aerial predators, and the responses of squirrels varied appropriately according to the context of calls, implying that calling conveyed correct information concerning the nature of the danger. Alarm calling elicited by naturally occurring encounters with potential predators during 454 h of observation, and by a thrown frisbee in 70 experimental trials, was not equally probable for all age/sex classes. Squirrels were most likely to call when they had offspring or siblings nearby, which is supportive of the hypothesis that alarm calling is maintained by kin selection. Adult males, residing in the vicinity of either their probable progeny or their nonlittermate half-siblings, were the most likely age/sex class to call during the lactation period when young were below ground and were most vulnerable. I conclude that alarm calling by Richardson's ground squirrels is nepotistic rather than manipulative. Introduction},

Littermates interacted more frequently than other pair types and showed the highest proportion of cohesive behaviour and the least agonism. Strangers interacted less frequently than all other pair types, showed the fewest recognition contacts, and were the least cohesive and most agonistic. Neighhours interacted less than littermates, but more than strangers, and showed intermediate levels of cohesion and agonism. Neighbours also engaged in more recognition contacts than strangers, but did not have fewer recognition contacts than littermates. Results suggest that the discrimination of littermates from neighbouring juveniles persists in the natural context. Comparisons of the behaviour of related vs unrelated neighbours reveal that neighbour/stranger discrimination is contingent upon differential familiarity.

We highlight a need to be more comparative, using nonapeptide (vasopressin and oxytocin) modulation of social behavior as an example. We reconsider the use of model organisms and the term â€˜socialâ€™ in this context, contrasting two popular models for nonapeptide regulation of social behavior. We then propose that a frame of reference should be established by studying mechanisms of behavior across taxa along the same continua. If we are to ever establish a unifying theory of behavior, we must transcend individual examples and determine the relative relationships of behavior and mechanism among and between species.,},

  abstract = {Oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (VP) are known modulators of social behaviour across rodents. Research has revealed the location of action of these nonapeptides through localization of their associated receptors, which include the oxytocin receptor (OTR) and the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR). As research into these complex systems has progressed, studies investigating how these systems modulate behaviour have remained relatively narrow in scope (ie, focused on how a single brain region shapes behaviour in only a handful of species). However, the brain regions that regulate social behaviour are part of interconnected neural networks for which coordinated activity enables behavioural variation. Thus, to better understand how nonapeptide systems have evolved under different selective pressures among rodent species, we conducted a meta-analysis using a multivariate comparative method to examine the patterns of OTR and V1aR density expression in this taxon. Several brain regions were highly correlated based on their OTR and V1aR binding patterns across species, supporting the notion that the distribution of these receptors is highly conserved in rodents. However, our results also revealed that specific patterns of V1aR density differed from OTR density, and within-genus variance for V1aR was low compared to between-genus variance, suggesting that these systems have responded and evolved quite differently to selective pressures over evolutionary time. We propose that, in addition to examining single brain regions of interest, taking a broad comparative approach when studying the OT and VP systems is important for understanding how the systemic action of nonapeptides modulate social behaviour across species.},

  abstract = {During pregnancy, females undergo several physiologically driven changes that facilitate adaptive behaviours and prepare the mother to care for her developing offspring. The nonapeptide hormone oxytocin is best recognised for its involvement in mammalian pregnancy and has been tightly associated with maternal care, in addition to its roles in pregnancy, parturition, and lactation. A closely related nonapeptide hormone, arganine vasopressin, has received considerably less attention for its role in pregnancy but has recently been implicated in modulating maternal care and aggression. Here, we examine the expression patterns of receptors for oxytocin (OTR) and vasopressin (V1aR) over the course of pregnancy, ranging from non-mated virgin to immediately postpartum female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Surprisingly, we found that OTR was highly stable in all measured structures in the forebrain. V1aR was also stable throughout most of the brain. Two exceptions to this were found in the ventral pallidum (VPall) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN); both significantly correlated with the length of time females were pregnant. Changes in the PVN may reflect functional feedback in vasopressin release, or preparatory changes for ensuing maternal behaviour. The results also indicate an unappreciated role for VPall V1aR in pregnancy, which may relate to the function of the VPall in hedonic `liking' and motivational `wanting.' Taken together, our data indicate that with a few compelling exceptions, nonapeptide dynamics during prairie vole pregnancy are largely limited to changes in the synthesis and release of oxytocin and vasopressin, not the receptors to which they bind.},
